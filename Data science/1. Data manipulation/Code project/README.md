# Data Science - Average of Rows

In a matrix, or 2-d array X, the averages (or means) of the elements of rows is called row means.

**Task**: Given a 2D array, return the **row means**.

**Input format**: 
- **First line**: two integers separated by spaces, the first indicates the rows of matrix X (n) and the second indicates the columns of X (p)
- **Next *n* lines**: values of the row in X

**Output format**: An numpy 1d array of values **rounded to the second decimal**.

- **Sample input**:  
```
2 2
1.5 1
2 2.9
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
[1.25 2.45]
```

>**Explanation**: The first row has two numbers 1.5 and 1, thus the **sum** is `1.5 + 1 = 2.5` and the **mean** is then `2.5 / 2 = 1.25`. Then for the second row, the average is calculated as `(2 + 2.9) / 2 = 4.9 / 2 = 2.45`.
