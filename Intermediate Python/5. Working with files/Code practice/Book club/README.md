# Working with Files

You are given a `books.txt` file, which includes book titles, each on a separate line.

Create a program to output how many words each title contains, in the following format:
```
Line 1: 3 words
Line 2: 5 words
...
```

Make sure to match the above-mentioned format in the output.

>To count the number of words in a given string, you can use the `split()` function, or, alternatively, count the number of spaces (for example, if a string contains 2 spaces, then it contains 3 words).
