# Registration System

You are making a registration form for a website.

The form has a `name` field, which should be **more than 3 characters long**. Any `name` that has **less than 4 characters** is invalid.

Complete the code to take the `name` as input, and raise an exception if the `name` is invalid, outputting `Invalid Name`. Output `Account Created` if it is valid.

**Sample input**: 
```
abc
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Invalid Name
```

>Use `try/raise/except` statements.
