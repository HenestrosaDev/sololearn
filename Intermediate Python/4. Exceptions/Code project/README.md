# Registration System

You are making a registration form for a website.

The form has a `name` field, which should be **more than 3 characters long**. Any `name` that has **less than 4 characters** is invalid.

Complete the code to take the `name` as input, and raise an exception if the `name` is invalid, outputting `Invalid Name`. Output `Account Created` if it is valid.

- **Sample input**: `abc`
- **Sample output**: `Invalid Name`

>Use `try/raise/except` statements.
