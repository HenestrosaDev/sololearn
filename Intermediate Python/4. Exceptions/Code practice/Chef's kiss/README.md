You are making a digital menu to order food. The menu is stored as a **list** of items.

Your program needs to take the `index` of the item as input and output the **item name**.
In case the index is not valid, you should output `Item not found`. In case the `index` is valid and the item name is output successfully, you should output `Thanks for your order`.

- **Sample input**: 
```
2
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Cheeseburger
Thanks for your order
```

>Handle the cases when the input is out of range, as well as when it is not a number.
