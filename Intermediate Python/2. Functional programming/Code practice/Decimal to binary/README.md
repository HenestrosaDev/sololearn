# Recursion

The given code defines a recursive function `convert()`, which needs to convert its argument from decimal to binary. However, the code has an error.

Fix the code by adding the **base case** for the **recursion**, then take a number from user input and call the `convert()` function, to output the result.

- **Sample input**: `8`
- **Sample output**: `1000`

>The binary representation of **8** is **1000**.
