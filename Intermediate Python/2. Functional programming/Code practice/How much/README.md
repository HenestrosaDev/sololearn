# Lambda

You are given code that should calculate the corresponding `percentage` of a `price`.

Somebody wrote a lambda function to accomplish that, however the `lambda` is wrong. Fix the code to output the given `percentage` of the `price`.

- **Sample Input**:  
```
50
10
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
5.0
```

>The first input is the `price`, while the second input is the `percentage` we need to calculate: **10% of 50 is 5.0**.
