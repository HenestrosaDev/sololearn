# Inheritance

You are making a drawing application, which has a `Shape` base class.

The given code defines a `Rectangle` class, creates a `Rectangle` object and calls its `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.

Do the following to complete the program:
1. Inherit the `Rectangle` class from `Shape`.
2. Define the `perimeter()` method in the `Rectangle` class, printing the `perimeter` of the rectangle.

>The `perimeter` is equal to` 2 * (width + height)`
