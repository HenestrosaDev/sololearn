# Properties

We are improving our game and need to add an `isAlive` property, which returns `True` if the lives count is `greater than 0`.

Complete the code by adding the `isAlive` property.

>The code uses a `while` loop to hit the `Player`, until its lives count becomes **0**, using the `isAlive` property to make the condition.
