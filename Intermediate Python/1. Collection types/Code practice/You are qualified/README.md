# Sets

You are working on a recruitment platform, which should match the available jobs and the candidates based on their skills.

The skills required for the job, and the candidate's skills are stored in **sets**.

Complete the program to output the matched skill.

>You can use the **intersect** operator (`&`) to get the values present in both sets.
