# Palindrome Numbers

A `palindromic` number is a number (such as 626) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

Write a function that returns `true` if a given number is a palindrome, and `false`, if it is not.

Complete the given function, so that the code in main works and results in the expected output.

- **Sample Input:** 13431
- **Sample Output:** 13431 is a palindrome

>To check if a number is palindrome, you need to reverse it and compare with the original one.
