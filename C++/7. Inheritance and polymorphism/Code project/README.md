# Queue Management (part 3)

Your `Queue` class is up and working in a customer service company. The company opens up a new branch and asks you to make another version of the Queue for them. The only difference is the way the Queue is displayed: each number on a new line.

You decide to create a new class called `Queue2`, which is derived from the `Queue` class and overrides the `print()` method, outputting each element of the queue on a new line.

>Do not forget to change the access specifier of the `Queue` members, as they won't be inherited if private.
