# Ticket Office

You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs **$10**.

The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by **the age of the youngest person in the group**.

You need to create a program that takes the ages of all **5 people** as input and outputs the **total price of the tickets**.

---

**Sample input**:
```
55
28
15
38
63
```

**Sample output**:
```
42.5
```

---

The youngest age is 15, so the group gets a **15%** discount from the total price, which is `$50 - 15% = $42.5`

>The given code is declaring an array of 5 elements and taking them from input using a **loop**.
