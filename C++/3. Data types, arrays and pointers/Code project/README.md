# Ticket Office

You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10.
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.

You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.

- **Sample Input:**<br>
55<br>
28<br>
15<br>
38<br>
63

- **Sample Output:**<br>
42.5

The youngest age is 15, so the group gets a **15%** discount from the total price, which is **$50 - 15% = $42.5**

>The given code is declaring an array of 5 elements and taking them from input using a loop.
