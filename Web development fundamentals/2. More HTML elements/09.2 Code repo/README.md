# Page Sections

Now it's time to wrap our content in corresponding elements, so that we can style them later.

**Tasks**:
1. Wrap the entire content, which is currently under the `<body>` tag, in a `<section>` tag.
2. Add a `<footer>` element after the `<section>` with the text "Copyright".

>We will style the sections later, in the CSS module.
