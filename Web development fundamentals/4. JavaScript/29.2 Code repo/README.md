# Basic Math

In this module we will be making the ticket buying form interactive, so that it can calculate the price of the selected tickets and output it.

As the first step, we need to declare variables to store the values.

**Tasks**:
1. Declare two variables, one called `adults`, the other one `children`, and initialize them to some values, for example `42` and `8`.
2. Declare another variable called `price`, which will hold the total price of the tickets.
3. Calculate the price of all tickets by using the following prices: Adults: $12, Children: $6.
4. Output the price value to the console.

>**Hint**: The price should be calculated using the following equation: `price = adults * 12 + children * 6`;
