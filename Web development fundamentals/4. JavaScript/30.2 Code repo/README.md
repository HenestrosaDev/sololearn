# Decision Making

As we will be taking the number of tickets from the input fields, we need to do some validation, as the user might enter wrong inputs, for example, negative numbers.

**Task**: For both adults and children variables, add an if statement that checks, if the value is negative. In case it is, assign it the value 0.

Here is an example `if` statement:
```
if (adults < 0) {
  adults = 0;
} 
```

>**Hint**: Check your code by assigning a negative value to the variables and reviewing the resulting price.
