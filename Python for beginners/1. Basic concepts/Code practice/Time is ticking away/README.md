# Quotient & Remainder

Random task! You need to calculate the number of hours in **888** minutes.

Your program needs to output the number of hours and then the number of remaining minutes, on separate lines.

For example, 72 minutes are equal to 1 hour and 12 minutes, so your program would output:  
```
1  
12
```

>You can use **floor division** to find the number of hours, and the **modulo** operator to find the remaining minutes.  
>Use separate **print()** statements for each output.
