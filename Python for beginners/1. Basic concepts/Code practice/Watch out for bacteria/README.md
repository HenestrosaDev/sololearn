# Exponentiation

Did you know that there are more bacteria cells in your body than cells that make up your body? Weird!

A bacteria culture starts with **500** bacteria and doubles in size every hour.
Which means, **after 1 hour** the number of bacteria is **1000**, after 2 hours - 2000, and so on.

Let's calculate and output the number of bacteria that will be in the culture after 24 hours.

>The formula to calculate the bacteria after N hours will be: `500*2á´º`
