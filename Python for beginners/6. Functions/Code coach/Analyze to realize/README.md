# List Functions

You're analyzing a data set and need to remove the outliers (the smallest and largest values.
The data is stored in a list).

Complete the code to remove the smallest and largest elements from the list and output the sum of the remaining numbers.

> Remember the functions a list supports: `min` and `max` can be used to get the smallest and largest numbers.
