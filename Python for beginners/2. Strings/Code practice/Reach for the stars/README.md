# Newlines

This code tries to make a triangle out of stars. But oh no! There's an error in there somewhere-it outputs all the stars on one line, instead of separate lines.

Fix the code to output a triangle of stars that has 4 rows.

>You can use `\n` newlines to create line breaks in the string.  
>**Important**: Remove any extra spaces to match the required output.
