# List Slices

Reversing a string is a common task during coding interviews.

Given a string as input, output its reverse.

- **Sample input**: `hello world`
- **Sample output**: `dlrow olleh`

> Remember, a string is a list of characters, and you can reverse a string the same way you would reverse a list.
