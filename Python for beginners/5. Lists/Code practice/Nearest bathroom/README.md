# Ranges

A group of buildings have restrooms on every **5th** floor.
For example, a building with 12 floors has restrooms on the 5th and 10th floors.

Create a program that takes the total number of floors as input and outputs the floors that have restrooms.

- **Sample input**:  
```
23
```

- **Sample output**:
```
5
10
15
20
```

> You can define a range with the corresponding rules and output the numbers in that range.  
Remember, that `range(a, b)` includes `a`, but does not include `b`.
