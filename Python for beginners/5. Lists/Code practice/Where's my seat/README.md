# Lists

The seats in your ticketing program are stored in a 2D list. Each seat is assigned a letter code.

Complete the program to take the seat row and column as input and output the corresponding code from the list (row and column indices start from 0).

- **Sample input**:
```
3
2
```

- **Sample output**:
```
l
```

> Note, that you need to convert the `input()` to **int**, in order to use it as an index.
