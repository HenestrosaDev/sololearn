# Sum of Consecutive Numbers

No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.

Let's save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you! Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).

---

**Sample input**: 
```
100
```

**Sample output**: 
```
5050
```

---

**Explanation**: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to **5050**.

> You can iterate over a range and calculate the sum of all numbers in the range.  
Remember, `range(a, b)` does not include `b`, thus you need to use `b+1` to include `b` in the range.
