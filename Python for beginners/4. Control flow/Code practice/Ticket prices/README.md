You are making a ticketing system. The price of a single ticket is **$100**. For children under 3 years old, the ticket is **free**.

Your program needs to take the ages of **5** passengers as input and output the total price for their tickets.

- **Sample input**:  
`18`  
`24`  
`2`  
`5`  
`42`

- **Sample output**:  
`400`

> There is one child under 3 among the passengers, so the total price of 5 tickets will be **$400**.
