# if Statement

You're making a gold purity checker, that should accept only 22K or 24K gold. Only the good stuff!

22K gold has 91.7% or more gold in it, while 24K corresponds to 99.9% and above purity.

Given the % of gold purity as input, you should output "Accepted" only if it corresponds to 22 or 24K.

- **Sample input**: `93.4`
- **Sample output**: `Accepted`

> Do not output anything if the gold corresponds to lower purity levels.
