# Tip Calculator

When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure! You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.

Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a **float**.

- **Sample input**: `50`
- **Sample output**: `10.0`

> **Explanation**: 20% of 50 is 10.  
To calculate 20% of a given amount, you can multiply the number by 20 and divide it by 100: `50*20/100 = 10.0`
