# Taking User Input

You're working on a notification system and need to make the notification text eye-catching.

Write a program that takes the text as input and outputs it by adding 3 stars at the beginning and the end.

**Sample input**: 
```
this is awesome
```

**Sample output**: 
```
*** this is awesome ***
```

>Note, there are **spaces** between the stars and the text.
