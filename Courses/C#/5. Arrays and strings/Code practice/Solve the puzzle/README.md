# Arrays

A game machine has 5 games installed on it:
```
string[] games = { 
	"Alien Shooter", 
	"Tic Tac Toe", 
	"Snake", 
	"Puzzle", 
	"Football" 
};

Write a program to take N number as input and output the corresponding game with N index from the array.

If user enters an invalid number that is out of array range, the program should output `Invalid number`.
