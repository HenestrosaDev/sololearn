# Robot-barman

You have a robot-barman and his goal is to neatly arrange drinks on the shelves of the bar. He is very smart and takes as many drinks as necessary to evenly distribute them on the shelves, but he still has problems with divisions.

The program installed in the robot takes the number of drinks and the number of the shelves as input. Complete the program to evenly distribute the drinks on shelves by dividing the number of drinks by the number of shelves and outputting the result.

The program must also, handle these two possible problems:
1. the divider (the number of shelves) should never be zero.
2. both inputs should be integers.

For the first exception, the program should output `At least 1 shelf` and, for the second, `Please insert an integer`.

**Sample input**:  
```
6
two
```

**Sample output**:  
```
Please insert an integer
```

>Use `DivideByZeroException` for the first exception and `FormatException` for the second one.
