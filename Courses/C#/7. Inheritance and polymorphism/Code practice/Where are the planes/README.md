# Derived Class Constructor & Destructor

You are the airport administrator responsible for setting flight statuses.
At first the flight program was showing only `Registration` and `Closed` statuses, but we need to expand it to give more detailed information.

Derive `WayStatus` class from `Flight` class and complete its
1. constructor, to output `On the way`
2. destructor, to output `Landed`

so that the program correctly outputs all the statuses of the flight.

>Remember, that while creating derived class object the **constructor and the destructor of base class also called** - the constructor is called at beginning and the destructor at very end.
