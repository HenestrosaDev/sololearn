# Nested if Statements

The sales manager decided to give a gift card to the customers whose purchases total **more than 15000**. On top of this, the customers whose **total purchase is above 30000** will receive a **second gift card**.

You are given a program, which takes the purchase `amount` as input, and print `Gift card` if it is **above 15000**.

---

**Task**: Complete the code to print `Gift card` again if the purchase is **above 30000**.

---

**Sample input**:  
```

```

**Sample output**:
