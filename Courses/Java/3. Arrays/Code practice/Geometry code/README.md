# Enhanced for Loop

Your company is writing a program for a geometry course.

The program takes the **number of squares** as the first input, creates an array, and then takes the sides of squares as its elements.

Write the part of the program that receives a list of square sides and prints the **area** of those squares for the user.

---

**Sample input**:  
```
2
3
4
```

**Sample output**:  
```
9
16
```

---

**Explanation**: In this example we have 2 squares (the first input) and their sides accordingly - **3 and 4** (the second and the third inputs). The area of the first square is 9 (3 * 3), the second one 16 (4 * 4).

>The area of a square is a square of its edges.
