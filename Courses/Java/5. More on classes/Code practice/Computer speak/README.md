# Casting

Computers understand only numbers, so every character has a numeric representation.
The program you are given takes a **character** as input. Write a program to output its **numeric** value.

**Sample input**: 
```

**Sample output**: 
```

>Use **cast** to assign value of character to an **integer**.
