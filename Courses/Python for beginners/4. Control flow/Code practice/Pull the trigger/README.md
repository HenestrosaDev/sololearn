# while Loop

You are making a game! The player tries to shoot an object and can hit or miss it. The player starts with 100 points, with a hit adding 10 points to the player's score, and a miss deducting 20 points.

Your program needs to take 4 action results as input (`hit` or `miss`), calculate and output the player's remaining points.

---

**Sample input**:  
```
hit
hit
miss
hit
```

**Sample output**:  
```
110
```

---

**Explanation**: 3 hits add 30 points, one miss deducts 20, making the total points equal to **110**.

>Use a `while` loop to take input during each iteration and calculate the points.
