# Abstraction

You decide to make the `Component` class `abstract`, since you are not going to create objects of that type.

You also add a `show()` function to it that the derived classes need to override.

For a `Button`, the `show()` function should output `Showing a Button`, while for an `Image` it should output `Showing an Image`.

>Implement the required `show()` function to generate the expected output.
