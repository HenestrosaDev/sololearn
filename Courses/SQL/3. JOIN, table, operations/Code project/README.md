# Zoo

You manage a zoo. Each animal in the zoo comes from a different country. Here are the tables you have:

`Animals`:

1. A new animal has come in, with the following details:
`name` - **Slim**, `type` - **Giraffe**, `country_id` - **1**
Add him to the `Animals` table.
2. You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zoo's visitors. Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, **sorted by countries**.

>Recall `INSERT` and `INNER JOIN` keywords.
