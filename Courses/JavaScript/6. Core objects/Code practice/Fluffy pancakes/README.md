# Arrays

The array you are given represents the menu of breakfast options available at the hotel. The Chef decided to replace one of the options with "Fluffy Pancakes".

Write a program to take the index as input, replace the element with that index with "Fluffy Pancakes", and output the new menu to the console as an array.

**Sample input**:
```
2

**Sample output**:
```
[
    'Cinnamon Doughnuts',
    'Waffles',
    'Fluffy Pancakes',
    'Chorizo Burrito',
    'French Toast'
]
```

The element with index 2 has been replaced in the output array.
