# Welcome to Code Repo!

Welcome to **Code Repo**! During this project, we will build an **HTML** structure step by step from scratch for your CV!

Review the task, write your code, and commit it to save your progress.

First, let's define our page title and write your first and last name at the top.

**Task**:
1. Add a `<title>` element to the head section and write the name of your CV inside it.
2. Write your first and last name in the body section.

>Remember to close the `<title>` element with the closing tag `</title>`.
