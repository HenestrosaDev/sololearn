# Queue Management (part 2)

We continue to develop our Queue management system that we made in the previous module.

You are asked to add a new functionality: adding two queues together. The result should be a new queue, where the elements of the first queue come first, followed by the second queue's elements.

Given the `Queue` class, overload the + operator, so that the code in main works and successfully adds two queues.

>The overloaded operator should return a new `Queue` object, which contains the elements of the first queue, followed by the elements of the second queue.
