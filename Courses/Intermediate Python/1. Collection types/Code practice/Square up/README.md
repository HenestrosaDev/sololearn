# Tuple Unpacking

Tuples can be used to output multiple values from a function.

You need to make a function called `calc()`, that will take the side length of a square as its argument and return the **perimeter** and **area** using a **tuple**. The perimeter is the **sum of all sides**, while the area is the **square of the side length**.

**Sample input**:  
```
3
```

**Sample output**:  
```
Perimeter: 12
Area: 9
```

>The given code takes a number from user input, passes it to the `calc()` function, and uses unpacking to get the returned values.
