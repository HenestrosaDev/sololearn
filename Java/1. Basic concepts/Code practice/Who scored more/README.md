# Increment & Decrement

Tom and Bob are playing a board game, in which both players start with the same number of points. Tom won the first game and got 1 point, while Bob lost the game, and therefore lost 1 point.

You are given a program that is intended to take the initial score and increase Tom's score by 1 and decrease Bob's score by 1.
But something is wrong: the program outputs the scores without the change.

**Task**: Fix the program to result in the expected outputs.

- **Sample input**:  
```
5
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Round 1 results:
6
4
```

**Explanation**: Both players had 5 points at the start of the game. After the first game, Tom gained 1 point (6, the first outputted number), and Bob lost 1 point (4, the second outputted number).

>Remember the difference between **prefix** and **postfix** operators. It will help you a lot in this task.
