# Multiple Exceptions

You need to write a divider program which will operate with integers.

The program you are given should take **two integers** as input and execute the division, but we need to handle two exceptions:
1. the divider shouldn't be **zero**
2. both inputs should be **integers**.

Complete the program to handle them. For the first exception, the program should output `Mistake: division by zero` and, for the second one, `Mistake: wrong value type`.

- **Sample input**:  
`1`  
`b`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Mistake: wrong value type`

>Use `ArithmeticException` for first exception and `InputMismatchException` for the second one.
