# ArrayList

The program you are given declares an **even nums** `ArrayList`.

Write a program to take numbers as input and add them an `ArrayList` while the size of the `ArrayList` **isn't equal to 3**. Then calculate and output the **average** of all values in integers.

- **Sample input**:  
```
5

```

- **Sample output**:  
```

```

>Use `evennums.size()` in `while` loop condition.
