# Bowling Game

The given code declares a ```Bowling``` class with its constructor and ```addPlayer()``` method.

Each player of the game has a name and points, and are stored in the players ```HashMap```.

The code in main takes 3 players data as input and adds them to the game.

You need to add a ```getWinner()``` method to the class, which calculates and outputs the name of the player with the maximum points.

- **Sample Input:**<br>
Dave 42<br>
Amy 103<br>
Rob 64

- **Sample Output:**<br>
Amy

>You need to iterate through the HashMap to find the element with the maximum points and output its corresponding key.
