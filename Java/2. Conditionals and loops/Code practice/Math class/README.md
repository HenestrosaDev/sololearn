# While Loops

For your math class you need a program to calculate the **factorial** of a number. You're given a program which takes a `number` as input.

**Task**: Complete the program to calculate the **factorial** of the given number and output it.

- **Sample input**: `6`
- **Sample output**: `720`

**Explanation**: The factorial of a number is equal to the product of all numbers less than or equal to the given number.

The factorial of 6 will be `6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720`.

**Hint**: Use `while` loop to calculate the factorial of the number.

>Use already defined fact variables in your calculations.
