# Nested if Statements

The sales manager decided to give a gift card to the customers whose purchases total **more than 15000**. On top of this, the customers whose **total purchase is above 30000** will receive a **second gift card**.

You are given a program, which takes the purchase `amount` as input, and print `Gift card` if it is **above 15000**.

**Task**: Complete the code to print `Gift card` again if the purchase is **above 30000**.

- **Sample input**:  
```
36000
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Gift card
Gift card
```

>Add an `if` statement inside the given one to handle the second condition.
