# Do While Loops

You're creating a bank security system. The user must insert the correct password in order to access payments. The password is **8819**.

**Task**: Write a program that will continuously take a password as input and output `Write password`, until the client inserts the correct password.

- **Sample input**:  
`3332`  
`8819`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Write password`  
`Write password`  

>Use `Scanner` in a `do while` loop to take input continuously.
