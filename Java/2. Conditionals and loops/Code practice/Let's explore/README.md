# Logical Statements

You're a tour manager and need a program that will identify small countries. A country is considered small if its **population is under 10000** and its **area is under 10000 hectares**.

The given program takes `population` and `area` as input.

**Task**: Complete the program to output `small country` if both conditions are met. Don't output anything otherwise.

- **Sample input**:  
```
9955
7522
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
small country
```

>Use `&&` to combine conditions.
