# The switch Statement

Your robot can recognize your emotions marked with number that represents each of them:

- **1**: You are happy!
- **2**: You are sad!
- **3**: You are angry!
- **4**: You are surprised!

Write a program that takes the emotion number as input and outputs the corresponding message in given format. If the input is an emotion that the program doesn’t know, it should output `Unknown emotion.`

- **Sample input**: `1`
- **Sample output**: `You are happy!`

>Don't forget about the `break` statement.
