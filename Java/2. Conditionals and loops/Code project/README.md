# Loan Calculator

You take a loan from a friend and need to calculate how much you will owe him after 3 months. You are going to pay him back 10% of the remaining loan amount each month.

Create a program that takes the loan amount as input, calculates and outputs the remaining amount after 3 months.

- **Sample input:**: `20000`
- **Sample output**: `10628`

Here is the monthly payment schedule:

- **Month 1:**  
Payment: 10% of 20000 = 2000  
Remaining amount: 18000

- **Month 2:**  
Payment: 10% of 18000 = 1800  
Remaining amount: 16200

- **Month 3:**  
Payment: 10% of 16200 = 1620  
Remaining amount: 14580

>Use a loop to calculate the payment and remaining amounts for each month. <br> 
Also, use **integers** for amounts.
