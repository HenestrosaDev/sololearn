# Shapes

You are working on a graphical app, which includes multiple different shapes.

The given code declares a base Shape class with an abstract ```area()``` method and a width attribute.

You need to create two ```Shape``` subclasses, ```Square``` and ```Circle```, which initialize the width attribute using their constructor, and define their ```area()``` methods.

The ```area()``` for the ```Square``` class should output the area of the square (the square of the width), while for the ```Circle```, it should output the area of the given circle (PI\*width\*width).

The code in main creates two objects with the given user input and calls the ```area()``` methods.

- **Sample Input:**<br>
5<br>
2

- **Sample Output:**<br>
25<br>
12.566370614359172

The area of the square is 5\*5=25, while the area of the circle is PI\*2\*2=12.566370614359172

>Use the ```Math.PI``` constant for the area calculation of the circle.
