# Interfaces

You love all animals, and have a dog and a cat as pets.

The program you are given defines an `abstract class Animal`, and has `Dog` & `Cat` classes inherited from it.

Implement the `Swimmer` and `Player` interface and override their methods `swim()` and `play()`, so that the given method calls output the following messages:

**swim()**:  
Dog => "Dog is swimming"  
Cat => "Cat is swimming"

**play()**:  
Dog => "Dog is playing"  
Cat => "Cat is playing"

>You can implement multiple interfaces by writing their names alternately separated by commas.  
Implement the `Swimmer` and `Player` interfaces only for `Animal` class, then override the `swim()` and `play()` methods in inherited classes.
