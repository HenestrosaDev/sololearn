# Binary Converter

The binary numeric system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.

You need to make a program to convert integer numbers to their binary representation.

Create a ```Converter``` class with a static ```toBinary``` method, which returns the binary version of its argument.

The code in main takes a number as input and calls the corresponding static method. Make sure the code works as expected.

- **Sample Input:** 42
- **Sample Output:** 101010

You can use the following code to convert a number to binary:
```
String binary = "";
while(num > 0) {
   binary = (num%2) + binary;
   num /= 2;
}
```

> The code above uses a loop to convert ```num``` to binary and stores the result in the ```binary``` String.
