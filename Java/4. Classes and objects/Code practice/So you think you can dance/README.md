# Method Return Types

You are an assistant on a TV show where celebrities are dancing and 4 judges evaluate their performance and give them a score between 1 and 10.

The program you are given takes the `scores` as input.

Complete the method to take them as parameters, then calculate and return the **average score**.

- **Sample input**:  
`6.0`
