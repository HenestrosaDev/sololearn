# Getters and Setters

The program you are given receives `name` and `age` of student as input.

Complete the program to set the values for the corresponding attributes of the `Student` class and prints out the final result. If the age is < 0, program should output `Invalid age` and assign a `0` value to the `age` attribute.

- **Sample input**:  
`Olivia`  
`-2`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Invalid age`
`Name: Olivia`
`Age: 0`

**Explanation**: `-2` is invalid value `for` age attribute, that's why `Invalid age` and `Age: 0` is printed. **Setter** and **Getter** should handle this.

>You need to handle the conditions inside the **Getter** and the **Setter**.
