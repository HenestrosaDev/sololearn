# Constructors

Your friend is a cashier at a movie theater. He knows that you are an awesome Java developer so he asked you to help him out and create a program that gets movie title, row, and seat information and prints out a new ticket.

Complete the existing code by adding a constructor to `Ticket` class so that it can be correctly initialized.

- **Sample input**:  
```
Jaws
5
1
```

- **Sample output**:
```
Movie: Jaws
Row: 5
Seat: 1
```

>You can figure out the constructor parameters by looking at the types of data that is being inputted.
