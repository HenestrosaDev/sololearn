# Creating Classes & Objects

Create a program to show loading message to your application users.

Define a class `Loading` which has one public method called `LoadingMessage()`, which should print `Loading` when called.

Create an object named `loading` and call that method.

>Don't forget to use `new` keyword while creating an object.
