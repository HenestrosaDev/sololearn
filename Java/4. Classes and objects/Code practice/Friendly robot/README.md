#Methods

You are creating a robot, **Welcomer 2000**, that never fails to greet a single person it encounters. You provide the number of people that will enter the room, and the robot will shout `Welcome` that number of times.

The program you are given already takes a number as input and calls the method according provided count. The issue is that the method is incomplete. Fix it.

- **Sample input**:  
```
2
```

- **Sample output**:
```
Welcome!
Welcome!
```

>You need to execute the output inside the method.
