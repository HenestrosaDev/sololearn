# Class Attributes

You are the administrator of a hotel and must create customer information cards for your new customers. On the card, you must note the customer’s first and last name, age, and room number.

The program you are given takes a guest's data (first name, last name, age, and room number) as input.

Complete the class by adding corresponding attributes so that the `saveCustomerInfo()` method works correctly. Also assign taken data values to attributes of created object.

- **Sample input**:  
```
John
Smith
35
204
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
First name: John
Second name: Smith
Age: 35
Room number: 204
```

>Be attentive to set **correct data types** for attributes.
