# Locating Contacts

You are given a dictionary that contains names and numbers of people. 

You need to create a DataFrame from the dictionary and add an index to it, which should be the name values.

Then, take a name from user input and output the row in the DataFrame, which corresponds to that row.

>Use `.loc` to find the specified row.
