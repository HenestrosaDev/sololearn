# Building Blocks

You are dividing up building block toys by color into even amounts for all the kids in a 15-person kindergarten class. You don't want to give anyone more than anyone else, so you might have some leftover blocks of each color in the end.  How many total do you have left over?

**Input format**: 4 integers that represent the blue, red, green, and yellow blocks that you are sorting out (in that order).
