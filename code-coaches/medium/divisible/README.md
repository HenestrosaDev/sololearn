# Divisible

You need to know if a number is divisible by each of a group of other numbers. If you are given the number and the group of other numbers, you will test to make sure that it is divisible by all of them.   

---
 
**Task**: Test your number against all the other numbers that you are given to make sure that it is divisible by them. 
 
---

**Input format**: Two inputs: an integer value (the number you are testing) and a string of variable length of the integers that you should test against separated by spaces. 
 
**Output format**: A string that says `divisible by all` or `not divisible by all`.
