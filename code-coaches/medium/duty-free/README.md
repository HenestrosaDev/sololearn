# Duty free

You make a purchase of souvenirs priced in Euros at a duty-free store in the Rome airport. You didn't want to spend any more than 20 US Dollars on any specific item.  
Can you go through your list and make sure you stayed under your limit? The conversion rate on this day is 1.1 US Dollars to 1 Euro.
