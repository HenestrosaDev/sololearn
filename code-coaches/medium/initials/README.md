# Initials

You are given a list of names for a fundraiser, but you need to keep the names relatively anonymous. You are tasked with getting the initials for each name provided.

**Task**: Given a list of first and last names, take the first letter from each name to create initials and output them as a space-separated string. 

---
 
**Input format**: The first input denotes the number of names in the list (N). The next N lines contain the list elements as strings.  
 
**Output format**: A string containing the initials of each name in the original list, separated by spaces.
