# Super Sale

Your favorite store is having a sale! You pay full price for the most expensive item that you get, but then you get 30% off of everything else in your purchase! How much are you going to save?

Sales tax is 7%. Also, you leave anything below a dollar in your saving as a tip to the seller. If your saving is a round amount, you don't leave any tips.
