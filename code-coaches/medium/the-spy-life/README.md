# The Spy Life

You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in the message to make it hard to decipher. 

---
 
**Task**: Create a program that will take the encoded message, flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space, and output the hidden message. 
 
---

**Input format**: A string of characters that represent the encoded message. 
 
**Output format**: A string of character that represent the intended secret message. 
 
---

**Sample input**: 
```
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Hello World
```

---

>**Explanation**: If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original message and flip it around, you get `Hello World`.
