# Credit Card Validator

You need to verify if the given credit card number is valid. For that you need to use the Luhn test. 
 
Here is the **Luhn formula**: 
1. Reverse the number. 
2. Multiple every second digit by 2.  
3. Subtract 9 from all numbers higher than 9. 
4. Add all the digits together. 
5. Modulo 10 of that sum should be equal to 0.

**Task**: Given a credit card number, validate that it is valid using the Luhn test. Also, all valid cards must have exactly 16 digits. 
 
---

**Input format**: A string containing the credit card number you need to verify. 
 
**Output format**: 'valid' in case the input is a valid credit card number (passes the Luhn test and is 16 digits long), or 'not valid', if it's not.

>**Explanation**: Let's run the Luhn test for our input:
>1. Reverse: 8893650651311904
>2. Multiplying the even positions by 2: 8 16 9 6 6 10 0 12 5 2 3 2 1 18 0 8 
>3. Subtract 9 from >9: 8 7 9 6 6 1 0 3 5 2 3 2 1 9 0 8 
>4. The sum: 70 
>5. 70 Modulo 10 is 0.

>The input passed the Luhn test and contains 16 digits, making it a valid credit card number.
