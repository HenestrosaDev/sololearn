# Déjà Vu

You aren't paying attention and you accidentally type a bunch of random letters on your keyboard. You want to know if you ever typed the same letter twice, or if they are all unique letters. 
 
---

**Task**: If you are given a string of random letters, your task is to evaluate whether any letter is repeated in the string or if you only hit unique keys while you typing. 
 
---

**Input format**: A string of random letter characters (no numbers or other buttons were pressed). 
 
**Output format**: A string that says `Deja Vu` if any letter is repeated in the input string or a string that says `Unique` if there are no repeats.

**Sample input**: 
```
aaaaaaaghhhhjkll
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Deja Vu
```

>**Explanation**: Your program should output `Deja Vu` because there are many repetitions in `aaaaaaaghhhhjkll`.
