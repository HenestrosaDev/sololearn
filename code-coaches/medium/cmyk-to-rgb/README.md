# CMYK to RGB

The **CMYK** color model is the standard in the printing industry and refers to the primary colors of pigment: **C**yan, **M**agenta, **Y**ellow, and **B**lack.  
**K** stands for '**K**ey' since in 4-color printing the Cyan, Magenta and Yellow printing plates are carefully keyed or aligned with the key of the Black key plate. 

**RGB** (Red, Green and Blue) is the color space for digital images.

>The combination of RGB light creates white, while the combination of CMYK inks creates black.

A CMYK color can be converted to RGB using the following equations: 
- **R** = 255 × (1-**C**) × (1-**K**) 
- **G** = 255 × (1-**M**) × (1-**K**) 
- **B** = 255 × (1-**Y**) × (1-**K**)

>Remember, each component of a RGB color is in the range of `[0, 255]`, so the resulting decimal numbers should be rounded to the nearest integers.

**Task**: Given a color in CMYK format, output the corresponding RGB color.  
 
---

**Input format**: 4 decimal numbers in the range of `[0, 1]`, representing Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black.  
 
**Output format**: A string, representing the corresponding RGB color, each component separated by commas.

**Sample input**: 
```
0.4 
0.49 
0.552 
0.36
``` 
 
**Sample output**:  
```
98,83,73
```
