# Hofstadter's Q-Sequence

**Note**: Only SoloLearn tests 1 and 2 pass, but the provided code here is correct.

Hofstadter's Q-Sequence is a sequence of numbers where every integer above zero has a corresponding q-sequence value.   
You can determine the q-sequence value from a formula that tells you how far back in the sequence to go and add two values together.   
The first two values of the sequence are Q(1) = 1 and Q(2) = 1, and every number above 2 can be expressed according to the following formula (where `n` is your input value): `Q(n) = Q(n - Q(n - 1)) + Q(n - Q(n -2))`

**Task**: Given an integer value input, determine and output the corresponding q-sequence value. 

---
 
**Input format**: A positive integer value. 
 
**Output format**: A positive integer value that represents the value in the q-sequence that the input holds.

**Sample input**:  
```
5 
```
 
**Sample output**:
```
3
```

>**Explanation**: Q(5) = Q(5-Q(5-1))+Q(5-Q(5-2)) = Q(5-Q(4))+Q(5-Q(3)) = Q(5-3)+Q(5-2) = Q(2)+Q(3) = 1+2 = 3
