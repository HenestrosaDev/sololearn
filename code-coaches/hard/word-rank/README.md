# Word Rank

A word is a sequence of letters A-Z. Rearranging the letters in the word, you can come up with new words, composed of the same letters.  
For example, the letters in the word **TESTING** can be rearranged to result in **SETTING**. 
If we sort all the words made up of the same set of letters alphabetically, we can calculate the rank of each word.
