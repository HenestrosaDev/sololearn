# Password Validation

You're interviewing to join a security team. They want to see you build a password evaluator for your technical interview to validate the input. 
 
---

**Task**: Write a program that takes in a string as input and evaluates it as a valid password. The password is valid if it has at a minimum 2 numbers, 2 of the following special characters ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*') and a length of, at least, 7 characters. If the password passes the check, output `Strong`. Else, output `Weak`. 

---
 
**Input format**: A string representing the password to evaluate. 
 
**Output format**: A string that says `Strong` if the input meets the requirements, or `Weak`, if not.

**Sample input**: 
```
Hello@$World19
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Strong
```

>**Explanation**  
The password has 2 numbers, 2 of the defined special characters, and its length is 14, making it valid.
