# Isogram detector

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, whether they are consecutive or non-consecutive.   
Your job is to find a way to detect if a word is an isogram. 
 
---

**Task**: Write a program that takes in a string as input, detects if the string is an isogram and outputs `true` or `false` based on the result. 

---
  
**Input format**: A string containing one word. 
 
**Output format**: A string: true or false. 

---
 
**Sample input**:  
```
turbulence
``` 
 
**Sample Output**:
```
false
```

---

>**Explanation**: The word turbulence has multiple "u" and "e" in it, which would mean it is not an isogram.
