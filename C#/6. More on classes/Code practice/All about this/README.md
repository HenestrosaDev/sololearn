# The this Keyword

The program you are given takes 2 numbers as input and should calculate and output their average. But something is wrong.

Complete the `Avg` class by creating the constructor, where the 2 parameters will be assigned to members of the class.

---

**Sample input**:
```
5.0
4.0
```

**Sample output**:  
```
4.5
```

---

>Inside the constructor, use `this` keyword with class members for assignation.
