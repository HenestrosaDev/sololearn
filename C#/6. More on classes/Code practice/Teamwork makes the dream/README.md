# Operator Overloading

You and your friend are playing a game as one team. Each player must pass 2 rounds and gets points for each round passed.

The program you are given creates two `Score` objects where each round scores are stored (they are passed to a constructor).

Overload the `+` operator for the `Score` class to calculate the team score for every round.

>Remember to use `operator` keyword while operator overloading.
