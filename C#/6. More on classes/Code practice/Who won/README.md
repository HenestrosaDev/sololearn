# Destructors

Five participants have advanced to the final round of a TV trivia show, and it is time to announce the winner and end the game.

The program you are given defines the array of `finalists`, takes the **index** of the `winner` as input, and creates the `FinalRound` object.

Complete the `FinalRound` class by writing the needed code in constructor to take the **array** and the **winner index** as parameters and output the corresponding message to show the winner. Then create a **destructor** to finish the game and output `Game Over`.

- **Sample input**:  
`2`

- **Sample output**:  
`Winner is Leyla Brown`  
`Game Over`  

>Use `~` and the class name to create the destructor.
