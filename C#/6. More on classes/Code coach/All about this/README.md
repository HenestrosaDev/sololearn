# The this Keyword

The program you are given takes 2 numbers as input and should calculate and output their average. But something is wrong.

Complete the `Avg` class by creating the constructor, where the 2 parameters will be assigned to members of the class.

- **Sample input**:  
`5.0`  
`4.0`  

- **Sample output**:  
`4.5`

>Inside the constructor, use `this` keyword with class members for assignation.
