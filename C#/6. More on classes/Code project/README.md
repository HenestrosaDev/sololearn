# Dance

In a ballroom dancing competition, each dancer from a pair is evaluated separately, and then their points are summed up to get the total pair `score`.

The program you are given takes the names and the points of each dancer as input and creates a `DancerScore` objects for each dancer, using the taken `name` and `score` values as parameters for constructors.

Complete the given class, using overload + operator to return an new object where the names of dancers are in one string (see sample output) and the `score` is equal to the sum of their points.

The declaration of that object and the output of its points are already written in Main().

- **Sample input**:  
```
Dave
8
Jessica
7
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Dave & Jessica
15
```

>Remember to use the `operator` keyword.
