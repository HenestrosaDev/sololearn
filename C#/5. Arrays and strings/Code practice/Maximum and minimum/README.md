# Array Properties & Methods

Write a program to take 5 numbers as input, then calculate and output the sum of the maximum and the minimum inputted values.

- **Sample input**:  
```
5
6
14
2
1
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
15
```

**Explanation**: The minimum value is 1, the maximum is 14. So `14 + 1 = 15` should be output.

**Hint**: Create an array, use while loop to store the inputted numbers in it, and then do the calculations.

>Use the `Min` and `Max` methods to get the minimum and maximum values.
