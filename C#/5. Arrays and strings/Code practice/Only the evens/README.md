# Using Arrays in Loops

The program you are given takes 5 numbers as input and stores them in an array.

Complete the program to go through the array and output the the sum of even numbers.

- **Sample input**
`10`  
`890`  
`15`  
`3699`  
`14`  

- **Sample output**:  
`914`

**Hint**: An integer is even if it is divisible by two, so it means that n number is even if `n % 2 == 0`.

>You need to declare a **separate variable** to store the sum in it.
