# Working with Strings

You are creating an authentication system. The password shouldn't contain any of these symbols: `char[] notAllowedSymbols = { '!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', ',', '+', '-' };`

The given program takes the `password` as input.

---

**Task**: Write a program to output `Invalid` if it contains any disallowed symbols. If the password requirement is satisfied, program shouldn't output anything.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
yl1893!dm$
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Invalid
```

---

**Hint**: The message should be output only once regardless of how many disallowed symbols the password contains.

---

>Use the `for` / `foreach` loop to iterate through the array of disallowed symbols and check the condition, then use the `break` keyword to stop the iteration if the condition is evaluated as true.
