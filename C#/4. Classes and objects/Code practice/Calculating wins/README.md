We are developing a profile system for player of our online game. The program already takes the number of games and wins as input and creates a player object.

Complete the `GetWinRate()` method inside the given Player class to calculate and output the **win rate**.

- **Sample input**:  
`130`  
`70`  

- **Sample output**:  
`53`

**Explanation**: Win rate is calculated by this formula: `wins * 100 / games`. So, in this case win rate is `70 * 100 / 130 = 53` (the final result should be an **integer**).

>Notice that you should execute the **output** of the win rate inside the method.
