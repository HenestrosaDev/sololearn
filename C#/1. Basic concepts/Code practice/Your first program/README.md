# Your first C# program

Write a program to print `C# is cool`. Note that the sentence starts with a capital letter.

**Hint**: Both `Console.Write()` or `Console.WriteLine()` methods can be used.

>Remember to enclose the text into **double quotes** and end the statement with a **semicolon** (`;`).
