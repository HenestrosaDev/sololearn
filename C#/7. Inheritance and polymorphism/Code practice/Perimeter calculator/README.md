# Abstract Classes

The program you are given defines `abstract class Figure` and derives `Rectangle` and `Triangle` classes from it.

Add an abstract method `Perimeter` to class `Figure`, then override it in derived classes to calculate perimeters of the already created `Rectangle` and `Triangle` objects.

**Hints**:
- Perimeter of rectangle with width w and height h => `2 * w + 2 * h`
- Perimeter of triangle with sides s1, s2, s3 => `s1 + s2 + s3`

>The abstract `Perimeter` method inside abstract `Figure` class should have no body.
