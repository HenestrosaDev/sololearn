# Inheritance

The program you are given takes the brand and model of the car as input, and defines a `Vehicle` class with model property and `ShowModel()` method.

Complete the `Car` class to inherit the `Vehicle` class, and add the Model property and `ShowModel()` method so that the given method call of the car object works correctly (see sample output).

- **Sample input**:  
```
BMW
5 Series
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Brand: BMW
Model: 5 Series
```

>Use **semicolon** (`:`) to derive one class from another.
