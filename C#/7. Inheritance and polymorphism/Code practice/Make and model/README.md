# Inheritance

The program you are given takes the brand and model of the car as input, and defines a `Vehicle` class with model property and `ShowModel()` method.

Complete the `Car` class to inherit the `Vehicle` class, and add the Model property and `ShowModel()` method so that the given method call of the car object works correctly (see sample output).

- **Sample input**:  
`BMW`  
`5 Series`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Brand: BMW`  
`Model: 5 Series`  

>Use **semicolon** (`:`) to derive one class from another.
