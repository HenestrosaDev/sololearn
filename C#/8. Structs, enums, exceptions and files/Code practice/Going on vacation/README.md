# Exception handling

A tour operator offers package holidays in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal and France.

The program you are given defines an array with those options and takes **N** number as input.

Write a program to output the package option with **N** index. If the number is out of range, program should output `Wrong number`. Regardless of the option results, the program should output `Goodbye` at the end.

```

Goodbye
```
