# HashSet

We are hiring programmers on our team. There are 10 candidates, and we need to choose 3 of them.

In the program you are given, you have 10 candidates in a **hash set**. You need to take 3 names as input, add them to a new hiring **hash set** and check if they are present in our candidates set.

If they are, the program should output `Starting hiring process`. Otherwise, `Something is wrong`.

- **Sample input**:  
```
John
Susan
Daniel
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Starting hiring process
```

>`IsSubsetOf()` returns true if the hash set is a subset of the specified collection.
