# Queue

Write a program that will take 3 numbers as input and store them in a defined **queue**. Also, add code to output the sorted sequence of elements in the queue, separated by a space.

---

**Sample input**:  
```
6
3
14
```

**Sample output**:  
```
Queue: 6 3 14
Sorted: 3 6 14
```

---

>To copy the queue into a new array, use the `ToArray()` method of the queue: `int[] arr = queue.ToArray();`  
Then, recall the `Array.Sort()` method.
