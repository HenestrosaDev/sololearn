# Lists

You need to write a program for the game to sort player scores.

The program you are given takes **N** number as input, which represents the number of players, and defines a score list.

Complete the program to take **N** count of numbers (the scores) as input, store them in a **scores list**, sort and output them, each separated by a space.

- **Sample input**:  
`3`  
`12`  
`4`  
`5`  

- **Sample output**:  
`4 5 12`

>You need to execute the `Add()` method inside the `while` loop.
