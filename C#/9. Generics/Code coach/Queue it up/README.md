# Queue

Write a program that will take 3 numbers as input and store them in a defined **queue**. Also, add code to output the sorted sequence of elements in the queue, separated by a space.

- **Sample input**:  
`6`  
`3`  
`14`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Queue: 6 3 14`  
`Sorted: 3 6 14`  

>To copy the queue into a new array, use the `ToArray()` method of the queue: `int[] arr = queue.ToArray();`  
Then, recall the `Array.Sort()` method.
