# Generic Methods

You are writing a program that can output the value of a variable of any type. It takes a **string**, an **integer**, and a **double** value as input and then it should output them.

Create a generic method `Print` for a `Printer` class to execute the given calls correctly.

- **Sample input**:  
`Hello`  
`14`  
`7.6`  

- **Sample output**:  
`Showing Hello`  
`Showing 14`  
`Showing 7.6`  

>Note that there is no object of `Printer` class, so the **generic** method should be `static`.
