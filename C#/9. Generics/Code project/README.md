# Coffee Time

A coffee shop manager is running a promotion and wants to offer a discount for coffee drinks.

The program you are given takes the discount value as input and defines a dictionary, where the names of the coffee drinks are set as keys, and their prices are set as values. 

Modify it to discount all of the prices and output a new price list in the format shown below.

- **Sample input**:  
`10`

- **Sample output**:  
`Americano: 45`  
`Latte: 63`  
`Flat White: 54`  
`Espresso: 54`  
`Cappuccino: 72`  
`Mocha: 81`

>Use `coffee.Keys.ToArray()` inside the foreach loop.
Note the space after the `:` in the output.
