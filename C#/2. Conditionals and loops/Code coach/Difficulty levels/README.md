# The default Case

You are making a game, where the player selects the difficulty level:  
1 - Easy  
2 - Medium  
3 - Hard

You are given a program that takes the number as input.

Complete it so that it will output the corresponding difficulty level. If the user entered an invalid number, the program should output `Invalid option`.

- **Sample input**: `2`
- **Sample output**: `Medium`

>Use the `default` case to execute the invalid option message.
