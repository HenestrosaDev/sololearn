# INNER JOIN

You are working at a supermarket and you need to arrange products by categories. You are given the following tables:

`products`:  

![contentImage](https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=4876)

`categories`:

![contentImage](https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=4490)

Each **product** has a **category**.

Write a query to output all products with their categories (`productname`-`price`-`categoryname`) in one table.

>Don't forget about the `ON` keyword while using `INNER JOIN`.
