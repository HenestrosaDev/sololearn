You are manager in the supermarket.

Here is the `products` table showing a field for each item, along with the `expiredate` with the count of days remaining before item expiration.

You need to get rid of all the expired products.

Delete from the `products` table all the items whose `expiredate` is less than 1 and show the table without any expired items.

>The `DELETE` statement removes the data from the table **permanently**.
