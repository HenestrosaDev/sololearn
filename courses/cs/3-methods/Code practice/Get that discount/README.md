# Method Parameters

A store is running a promotion: if the total purchase price is equal to or exceeds 10000, the price will be **discounted by 20%**.

The program you are given takes the **total purchase price** as input.

Complete the given method to take the total purchase price as an argument, and calculate and return the discounted price if campaign's requirement is satisfied. The method should return the same price if discount is not given.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
13000
```

**Sample output**: 
```
10400
```

---

**Explanation**: `13000 > 10000`, so the discount should be given: `13000 - (0.2 * 13000) = 10400`.

**Hint**: You need to use `if else` statements inside the method.

>Don't forget to mention the **value type** for the method parameter before its name.  
Notice that method returns a value, so you need to use `Console.Write()` / `Console.WriteLine()` to execute the output.
