# The for Loop

Anna's hummingbird, now believed to be the fastest bird in the world relative to its size, can reach speeds of **80 km per hour**.

**Task**: Write a program to output how many kilometers it will travel each hour over **5 hours** of flight.

**Output**:
```
80
160
240
320
400
```

**Hints**: 
- Simply multiply 80 by a counter for each iteration. 
- Use the for loop to perform the multiplications iteratively.

>Note that in this case, it's better to start the loop counter **from 1**.  
Remember the **semicolon** (`;`) after initialization and the condition in the syntax.
