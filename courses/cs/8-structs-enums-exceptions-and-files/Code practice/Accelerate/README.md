# Enums

A racing video game has 3 difficulty levels: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`. Each difficulty level is assigned maximum time to complete the track: the higher the difficulty, the lower the time.

The program you are given defines `Player` class and `Difficulty` enum, and creates 3 `Player` objects with different difficulties as parameter for the constructor.

Complete the Player constructor, which takes the enum as a parameter to check the time for each difficulty option and outputs the corresponding message:
- Easy => `You have 3 minutes 45 seconds`
- Medium => `You have 3 minutes 20 seconds`
- Hard => `You have 3 minutes`

>Use a `switch` statement to check for each option of the enum and execute the output.
