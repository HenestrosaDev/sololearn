# Area of a Circle

We are going to write a program that will calculate the area of ​​a circle.

The area enclosed by a circle of radius _r_ is `πr²`, where _π_ (pi) is _the constant ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter_, and _r_ is the _radius_.
The given program declares a constant pi variable with a value of 3.14.

Complete the program to take the radius as input, then calculate and output the area of the circle.
