# Generic Classes

The class `Elems` creates a **3-sized array of integers**, defines `Add()` and `Show()` methods to store the elements into the array, and shows them separated by a space.

Modify the class to make it generic to execute the same actions with string type, given in the `Main` function.

>You need to replace the int type by the generic `<T>` type.  
>Each output should end with a **space** (including the last one).
