# Lists

You need to write a program for the game to sort player scores.

The program you are given takes **N** number as input, which represents the number of players, and defines a score list.

Complete the program to take **N** count of numbers (the scores) as input, store them in a **scores list**, sort and output them, each separated by a space.

**Sample input**:  
```
3
12
4
5
```

**Sample output**:  
```
4 5 12
```
