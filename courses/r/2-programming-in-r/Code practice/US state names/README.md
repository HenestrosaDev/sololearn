# US State Names

You need to make a program that takes a US state code as input and outputs its full name.

Here is a list that your program needs to support:
- **CA** - California
- **NY** - New York
- **FL** - Florida
- **OH** - Ohio

**Sample input**:
```
NY
```

**Sample output**:
```
[1] "New York"
```

>You can use a `switch` statement to define all the required cases.
