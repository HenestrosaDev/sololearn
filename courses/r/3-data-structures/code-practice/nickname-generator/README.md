# Nickname Maker

The given code defines a **dataframe** with names and **years of birth** of people.

You need to make a program that takes an index as input, and outputs the nickname of the person at that index in the dataframe.
The nickname should combine the name and the year together.

For example, the first person's nickname should be **James1988**.

>**Hint**: You can use the `paste()` function with the `sep=` parameter to combine two strings.
