# Grade Analysis

You have a dataframe that includes grades of students.
Your program needs to take a number as input, and output the number of students who have a grade greater than the given input.

For example, for the input **89**, the output should be `[1] 3`, as 3 students have grades greater than **89**.

>**Hint**: You can use the `length()` function to find the number of items in a vector.
