# Average Price

The given code defines a dataframe of product prices. It includes two columns: `price` and `tax`.

You need to create a new column for the dataframe called `total`, which should hold the sum of the price and tax columns for each row. 
Then, output the **mean** value of the `total` column.

>You can create a new column by simply assigning it a new vector of values.
