# Welcome to Code Repo!

In this project we will build a Jumper game from scratch.

We will start with basic web structure and advance to more complex animations and event handling as we progress through the lessons!
Review each task, write your code, commit it to save your progress, and continue to develop the project through each stage.

This will be fun, so let's get started!

Let's start with some basic HTML.

**Tasks**:
1. Add a heading with the text "My Jumper Game".
2. Add a paragraph below the heading that says, "A fun flappy-bird like game."

**Hint**: Add a heading and paragraph using their corresponding tags, for example:
```html
<h1>My Jumper Game</h1>
<p>A fun flappy-bird like game.</p>
```

Expected result:
