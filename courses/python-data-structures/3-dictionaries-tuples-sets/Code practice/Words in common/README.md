# Sets

Given **two sentences**, you need to find and **output the number of the common words** (words that are present in both sentences).

---

**Sample input**:  
```
this is some text
I would like this tea and some cookies
```

**Sample output**:  
```
2
```

---

The words '**some**' and '**this**' appear in both sentences.

---

>You can use the `split()` function to get a **list of words in a string** and then use the `set()` function to convert it into a set. For example, to convert the list `x` to a set you can use: `set(x)`
