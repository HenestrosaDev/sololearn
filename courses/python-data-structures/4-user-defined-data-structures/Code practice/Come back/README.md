# Stack

You need to make a **back** button for a browser.

You use a **stack** to store the website links visited. Each new link visited is pushed onto the stack.
The back button needs to pop the top link from the stack and navigate to it.

The given code declares a `Browser` class as a stack and implements some of its methods. Then, some links are pushed onto the stack. A `while` loop is then used to go back to all links and print them.

Implement the required `pop()` method for the `Browser`, so that the given code works as expected.

>Note, that the `pop()` method needs to return the value, so that it can be printed.
