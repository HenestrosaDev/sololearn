# Graphs

You are making a social network called `X`.

Connections between the users are stored as a **graph**. The given code declares an `X` class with its `add_friend()` method and creates some connections for **5 users**.

You need to **take a number** as input and **output the number of connections of the corresponding user**.

>Each user's connections are stored in the `adj` matrix.
