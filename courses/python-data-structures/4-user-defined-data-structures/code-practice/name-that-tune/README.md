# Linked List

You are making a `Music Player`, which allows you to create a playlist of tracks.
The given code defines `Player` and `Track` classes, where the `Player` is a **linked list**, chaining together `Track` objects.

The code takes a **number of tracks** from user input and adds them to the playlist.

You need to iterate over the linked list and output all the tracks in the playlist in the order of playback.

>Use a `while` loop to iterate over the linked list.
