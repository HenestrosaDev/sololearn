# String Operations

Let's test your coding skills!

Take a string as input and output each letter of the string on a new line, repeated **N** times, where **N** is the position of the letter in the string.

---

**Sample input**:  
```
data
```

**Sample output**:  
```
d
aa
ttt
aaaa
```

---

>**Hint**: Use a loop to iterate over the string, keeping the position number of the current iteration in a variable. Then use multiplication to repeat the letters.
