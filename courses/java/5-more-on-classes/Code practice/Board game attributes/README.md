# Abstract Classes

A board game company creates new board games every year. While all the games have different rules, they also are all similar in that they each have a name and a `play()` method.

We need to create 3 different games - Monopoly, Chess and Battleships. In the `play()` method Monopoly should print `Buy all property.`, Battleships - `Sink all ships.`, and Chess - `Kill the enemy king.`

Complete the code by implementing the `getName()` and `play()` methods inherited from abstract `Game` class.

>To give a name to games just return the name string inside the `getName()` function.
