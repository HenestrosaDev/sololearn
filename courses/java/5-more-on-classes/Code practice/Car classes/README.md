# Polymorphism

Vehicles can be classified according to what energy source powers them. The program you are given has 3 vehicle classes: `Vehicle`, `ElectricVehicle` and `HybridVehicle`.
`ElectricVehicle` and `HybridVehicle` classes are inherited from Vehicle class.

Complete the program by reimplementing method `resource()` in inherited classes, so that the given calls work correctly.

>The subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.
