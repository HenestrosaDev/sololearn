# Enums

Our shooter video game has 3 difficulty options - `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD`. For each difficulty level, the player has a corresponding number of bullets.

The program you are given defines `Player` class and `Difficulty` Enum, and creates **3** `Player` objects with different difficulties as parameters for the constructor.

Complete the `Player` constructor, which takes the Enum as a parameter to check number of bullets for each difficulty option and output the corresponding message:  
- EASY => "You have 3000 bullets"   
- MEDIUM => "You have 2000 bullets"   
- HARD => "You have 1000 bullets"   

>Use a `switch` statement to check for each option of the enum and output the corresponding message.
