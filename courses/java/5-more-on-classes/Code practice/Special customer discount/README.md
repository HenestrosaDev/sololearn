You are a store manager. You are offering a **10% discount** on all items in the store. 

Today, you have had a total of **two** customers. To the first, you honored the **10%** discount on all purchased items. The second customer, however, purchased a lot of items and you want to give him a bigger discount (**20%**) to show your appreciation.

Complete the program by creating two `Purchase` objects: one for the regular customer and one for a special one, and override the `totalAmount()` method for the special customer on the fly to set the proper **20% discount**.
