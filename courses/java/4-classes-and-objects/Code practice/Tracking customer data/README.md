# Class Attributes

You are the administrator of a hotel and must create customer information cards for your new customers. On the card, you must note the customerâ€™s first and last name, age, and room number.

The program you are given takes a guest's data (first name, last name, age, and room number) as input.

Complete the class by adding corresponding attributes so that the `saveCustomerInfo()` method works correctly. Also assign taken data values to attributes of created object.
