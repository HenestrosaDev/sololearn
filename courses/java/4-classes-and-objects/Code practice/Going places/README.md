# Access Modifiers

You're a tour manager and you need to have a list of countries along with its capitals.

You're given a program which creates `Country` object and you should output the `name` and the `capital`, but something goes wrong.

**Task**: Change the **access modifiers** of the `Country` class fields in order to perform the required output.

>Use `public` access modifier to provide access to any other classes.
