# Bowling Game

The given code declares a `Bowling` class with its constructor and `addPlayer()` method. Each player of the game has a name and points, and are stored in the players `HashMap`.

The code in `main` takes 3 players data as input and adds them to the game. You need to add a `getWinner()` method to the class, which calculates and outputs the name of the player with the maximum points.
