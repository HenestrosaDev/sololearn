# Letter Counter

Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string.

You decide to store the data in a **dictionary**, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values.

Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the **letter count**.

**Sample input**: 
```
hello
```

**Sample output**: 
```
{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
```

>You need to output the dictionary object. Note that the letters are in the order of appearance in the string.
