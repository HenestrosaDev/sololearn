# Title Encoder

You are given a file named `books.txt` with book titles, each on a separate line.

To encode the book titles you need to take the first letters of each word in the title and combine them. For example, for the book title **Game of Thrones** the encoded version should be `GoT`.

Complete the program to read the book title from the file and output the encoded versions, each on a new line.

>You can use the `split()` method to get a list of words in a string.
