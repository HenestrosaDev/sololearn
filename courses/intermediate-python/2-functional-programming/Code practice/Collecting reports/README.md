# Decorators

You are working on an invoicing system.

The system has an already defined `invoice()` function, which takes the invoice number as argument and outputs it.

You need to add a decorator for the `invoice()` function, that will print the invoice in the following format:

---

**Sample input**:  
```
42
```

**Sample output**:  
```
***
INVOICE #42
***
END OF PAGE
```

---

>The given code takes the invoice number as input and passes it to the **invoice()** function.
