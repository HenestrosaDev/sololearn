# Recursion

The given code defines a recursive function `convert()`, which needs to convert its argument from decimal to binary. However, the code has an error.

Fix the code by adding the **base case** for the **recursion**, then take a number from user input and call the `convert()` function, to output the result.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
8
```

**Sample output**: 
```
1000
```

---

>The binary representation of **8** is **1000**.
