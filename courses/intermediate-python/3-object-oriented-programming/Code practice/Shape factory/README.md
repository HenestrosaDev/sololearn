# Operator Overloading

We are improving our drawing application.

Our application needs to support adding and comparing two `Shape` objects.

Add the corresponding methods to enable addition (`+`) and comparison using the greater than (`>`) operator for the `Shape` class.

The addition should return a new object with the sum of the **widths** and **heights** of the operands, while the comparison should return the result of comparing the **areas** of the objects.

>The given code creates two `Shape` objects from user input, outputs the `area()` of their addition and compares them.
