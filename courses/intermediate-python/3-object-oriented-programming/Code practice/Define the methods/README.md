# Static Methods

The given code takes 2 numbers as input and calls the **static** `area()` method of the `Shape` class, to output the `area` of the shape, which is equal to the `height` multiplied by the `width`.

To make the code work, you need to define the Shape class, and the **static** `area()` method, which should return the multiplication of its two arguments.

>Use the `@staticmethod` decorator to define a **static** method.
