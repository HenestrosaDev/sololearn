# Data Hiding

We are working on a game. Our `Player` class has `name` and private `_lives` attributes.

The `hit()` method should **decrease** the lives of the player **by 1**. In case the lives **equal to 0**, it should output `Game Over`. Complete the `hit()` method to make the program work as expected.

>The code creates a `Player` object and calls its `hit()` method multiple times.
