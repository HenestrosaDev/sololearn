# Adding a picture

Can you guess what's missing? Yes, a picture! So let's add one.

**Task**:
1. Below the link, open the `<img>` tag and put the link to your picture inside the `src` attribute.
2. Add the `<br>` tag for a line break.

**Hint**: If you don't have a link, you can use [this one](https://sololearnassets.azureedge.net/home-why-code-1.svg) as a sample image.

**Example**:
```
<img src="https://sololearnassets.azureedge.net/home-why-code-1.svg"><br> 
```

>You can also add the `alt` attribute to tell the search engines the title of the image.
