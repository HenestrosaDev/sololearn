# Bulleted list

Sometimes a single paragraph may not be enough to get your message across. In such cases, it can be effective to use a clear bulleted list that provides additional information to our customers. This list can take the form of a user journey, product details, a list of products, etc.

**Task**:
1. Define a title for your bulleted list and enclose it into `<h2>` element.
2. Open the `<ul>`tag immediately below the title that you've just written.
3. Open the `<li>` tag for each of your list items. The first row of the content should be a **title**, followed by a **definition**.

**Template example**:
```
<h2>Your subheading</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your title for item 1<br>
    Your definition for item 1.</li>
    <li>Your title for item 2<br>
    Your definition for item 2.</li>
</ul>
 ```

**Content example**:
