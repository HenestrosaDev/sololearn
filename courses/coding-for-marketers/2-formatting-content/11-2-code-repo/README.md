# Follow Us

The next important elements that should appear in your Email are **links** to your social pages.
Let's add some.

**Task**:
1. Below your bulleted list, write your title for the section and enclose it into `<h3>` element.
2. Add several `<a>` tags, and in each one add a href attribute with your account link inside the quotes.
3. Add the names of the pages between the `<a>` and `</a>` tags.

**Example**
```html
<h3>Follow us</h3>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sololearn">Facebook</a>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sololearn-inc-/">LinkedIn</a>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sololearn/">Instagram</a>
