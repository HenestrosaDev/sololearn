# Main Message

It's time to write your main body content so that your audience understands what you are offering and the benefits it will provide them.

**Task**:
1. Below the link line, open the `<p>` element.
2. Summarize and write your main message inside `<p>` and `</p>` tags.

**Example**:
```html
<a href="www.sololearn.com" >Get started</a> <br>
<p>You have joined our growing group of learners who is looking to master a new programming language, become a developer, or just become more confident in their technical skills.</p> 
```

>The `<p>` element automatically adds a **line break**.
