# Call to Action

Having a **call to action** section is very important for marketing Emails.
So, let's define it by adding a **link** that will navigate the reader to the page we want.

**Task**:
1. Below your heading, open the `<a>` element and write your message to insert a call to action inside it.
2. Add a `href` attribute inside the `<a>` tag and place your link **between the quotes**.

**Example**:
```html
<a href="www.sololearn.com" >Get started</a> <br>
```

>Add a `<br>` tag after the closing `</a>` tag for line break.
