# Welcome to your Marketing Email Project!

Email marketing is one of the most effective tools to reach customers.

During this project, we will take a simple **HTML/CSS** template for your **Email**, write your content in it, format it, design it, and optimize its SEO so that you can use it for your marketing campaigns.

Review the task, write your code, and commit it to save your progress.

First, let's define a **title** for our Email.

**Task**: Inside the `<body>` section, open `<h1>` tag and write your title inside it.

**Example**:
```html
<body>
    <h1>We're glad you're here</h1>
</body>
```

>We also have provided predefined **CSS code** - you can ignore it for now, and we will do some magic with it later.
