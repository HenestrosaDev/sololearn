# Designing, Part 2

The next element we are going to tweak is your **link button**.
You probably already know that we predefined some **CSS code**. Let's link it to our HTML and see the magic.

**Task**:
1. Enclose the whole `<a>` element into the `<div>` section.
2. In the `<div>` tag, add the `class="btn"` attribute.
3. In the `<a>` tag, add the `class="button"` attribute.
4. 
Look at the code example below to get a better understanding of what we are going to do.

**Example**:
```
<div class="btn">
    <a  href="https://www.sololearn.com" class="button" >Get Started</a> <br>
</div>
<div class = "image">
    <img src="https://sololearnassets.azureedge.net/home-why-code-1.svg"><br>
</div>
```

Use the same trick for the picture - enclose the `<img>` element into the `<div class="image">` section.
