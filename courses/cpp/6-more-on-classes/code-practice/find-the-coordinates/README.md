# Friend

You are given a `Point` class, which defines a point on a 2D grid (x, y).
The program creates a `Point` in main based on user input and calls the `shift()` function, which should increment the coordinates by the given step.

However, the code is not working, as the coordinates are `private`. Modify the code to fix it.

>Remember, functions declared as friend in a class are able to modify the private members.
