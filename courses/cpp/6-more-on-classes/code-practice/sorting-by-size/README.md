# Member Initializers

You are making a program to store TVs with their `width` and `height`.

The given program declares a TV class with `height` and `width` members, an `area()` method, as well as a constructor that initializes the members of the class.

Complete the program by taking 2 integers as input, create a TV object by passing them to the constructor, and call the `area()` method.

>Note, that the constructor needs 2 integer values.
