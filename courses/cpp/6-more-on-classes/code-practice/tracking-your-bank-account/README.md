# Operator Overloading

You are creating a program for a `Bank` to manage `Accounts`. The given code declares an `Account` class which has a `balance` and `interest` members. The bank asks you to add a new functionality to merge two accounts together, resulting in a new account with the sum of the balances and interests of the given accounts.

Overload the `+` operator to allow adding two Account objects, adding the balances and interests.

>The overloaded operator should return a new `Account` object, with the corresponding member values.
