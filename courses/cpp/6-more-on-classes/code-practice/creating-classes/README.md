# Const Objects

You are making a `Number` class to handle different math operations. The class includes an integer member and a `square()` method.

You need to complete the `square()` method so that the given code executes successfully. The `square()` method should return **the square of num**.

>Note, that the object is **constant**, so it can call only constant methods.
