# Multi-Dimensional Arrays

You are given a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 3 columns â€” 9 elements.

Here is the array:
```cpp
string arr[3][3] = {
    {"Python", "JS", "C++"},
    {"PHP", "SQL", "Java"},
    {"C#", "Swift", "Kotlin"},
};
```

**Task**: Complete the code to output `C++`.

**Hint**: Don't forget that the index of the first element of the array is 0.

>In order to call the element with indexes `k`, `j` you should write `arr[k][j]`.
