# The `sizeof()` operator

You are given an array of integers which represents the ages of each employee in the office (see template). You need to obtain the number of employees, but there are too many to count manually.
Write a statement that will calculate the elements count defined in array and output the count.

>Use operator `sizeof()` to get the overall size of memory allocated by the array and the size of one element in that array.
