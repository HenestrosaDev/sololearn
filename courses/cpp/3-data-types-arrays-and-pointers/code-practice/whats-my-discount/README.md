Arrays

You are given an array of doubles of items in a store that have different prices (see template).
Write a program that takes the "percent off" discount as input and outputs discounted item prices on one line in the same sequence you are given, separated by a space (" ").

>To get a discounted price use the formula: `a â€“ a * p / 100`, where `a` is the initial price and `p` is the discount percent off.
