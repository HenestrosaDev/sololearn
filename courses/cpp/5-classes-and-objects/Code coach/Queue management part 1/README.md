# Queue Management (part 1)

You are working on a Queue management system and need to create the class to hold the queue data, which are customer IDs (integers).

You make a `Queue` class, which has a size attribute, and an array, to hold the data of the queue.
The class has a `remove()` method to remove the front item of the queue, a `print()` method to output the queue.

You need to create an `add()` method for the Queue class, that will take an item and add it to the end of the queue.
The code needs to be fully working, so that the Queue declaration and manipulation code in main() works.

>Do not forget to increment the **size** after adding the item to the array.
>Read the code carefully before making any changes.
