# Queue Management (part 4)

It's time to update your queue management system. The previous version supports only integer numbers and we need to support more types, such as strings, to store customer names in the queue.

Transform the given `Queue` class to a class template, which can work with different data types.

>The code in main declares two `Queue`: one for integers and another one for strings.
