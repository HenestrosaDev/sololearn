# Function Templates with Multiple Parameters

We have successfully created a `myMax()` function template, which returns the larger one of its parameters. However, it only works if the parameters have the same type.

Modify the given code to enable the function to work with different parameter types (the function is called with different data types in main).

>The result of the `myMax()` function should be of the type of its first parameter.
