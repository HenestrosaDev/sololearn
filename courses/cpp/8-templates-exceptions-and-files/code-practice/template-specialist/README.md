# Template Specialization

You are given a `Div` class template, which has a constructor that takes two parameters and outputs their division.
You need to specialize the class for `strings`, which should output the division of the lengths of the parameter strings, as the division operator is not defined for strings.

Create the template specialization so that the code in main executes correctly.

>You can get the length of a string using the `size()` function.
