# More on Exceptions

You are making a digital menu, which takes a number as user input, and outputs the corresponding menu item. However, the users can input anything, even numbers that are not present in the menu.

Handle wrong user input, by throwing an exception with code 404 and outputting `404 - not found`, if it is out of the range of the given menu.

>Note that the menu is given as an array, so you need to output the item corresponding to the input index, if it exists.
