# Exceptions

You are making a program to manage usernames. A valid username needs to be minimum 4, maximum 20 characters long.

Create a program to take a string as input, check its length and output `Valid` if the name is valid, or `Invalid`, if it is not.

>You can check the length of the input string using the `size()` function and throw an exception, if it is not valid.
