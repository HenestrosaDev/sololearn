# Function Templates

You need to write a function, which returns the maximum of its two parameters, and it should work for different data types (integers, doubles, etc.).

Create a function template called `myMax()`, which takes two parameters and returns the larger one, so that the code in main works as expected.

**Sample input**:
```
4.2
8.1
```

Sample Output
```
8.1
```

>Remember, the syntax for declaring a template function is `template <class T>`
