# Default arguments

Your usual order at your favorite cafÃ© is black tea, which the waiter brings you by default. Today, however, you are with your friend and it is his first time there. Obtain your friend's order in one word as input, and place the order for both of you. Complete the function so that it will output `Black tea` by default (without an argument) and then your friend's order as an argument.

**Sample input**:
```
Americano
```

Sample Output
```
Black tea
Americano
```

>Function should have one default argument set to `Black tea`.
>Don't forget about the line break after the output.
