# Protected Members

You work at a grocery store and want to build an app to manage the products in the store. You make a `Product` base class and separate classes for each product type.

Inherit the `Fruit` class from `Product` and make sure the given code works correctly.

>The code tries to access the private members of `Product` in the `Fruit` class. Fix it by applying the correct access specifier.
