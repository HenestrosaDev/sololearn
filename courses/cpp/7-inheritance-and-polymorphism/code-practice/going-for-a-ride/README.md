# Abstract Classes

You are given a `Vehicle` base class, and two subclasses, `Car` and `Bicycle`.
Both classes have a `drive()` method which is called in main, using `Vehicle` pointers.

Complete the `Vehicle` class, so that it correctly represents a `Vehicle` abstraction.

>Remember, an abstract class should include a pure virtual function, which the derived classes must implement.
