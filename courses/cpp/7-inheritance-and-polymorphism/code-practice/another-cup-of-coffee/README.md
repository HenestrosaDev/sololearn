# Polymorphism

Your friend made a program for a robot, which makes different drinks, including tea and coffee.

The code defines a `Drink` class, and separate `Tea` and `Coffee` classes.
It tries to create a `Tea` and `Coffee` object, set their prices with the corresponding method and call their `make()` method.
However, the code does not work, as it has multiple errors.

Find the errors in the code and fix them, so that the program runs as expected.

>Remember, to call a method with a pointer, you need to use the `->` operator, whereas on an object you need to use the dot operator.
