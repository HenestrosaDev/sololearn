# Inheritance

You are making a drawing application. The code you are given declares a `Shape` base class, and you are making separate classes for each shape that your application is going to support.

Inherit the `Rectangle` class from the `Shape` class and call its `draw()` method.

>Inherit using a colon and an access specifier.
