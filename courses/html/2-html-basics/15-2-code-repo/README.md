# Skills

A necessary and valuable part of every CV is the **Skills** section, which employers use to compare your skills with their position requirements. It's common practice to present skills using a table. So, let's do that!

**Task**:  
1. Define a table with `<table>` tag and add a border using the border attribute.
2. Add `<tr>` tags - each tag will be a row representing corresponding category.
3. Inside each row add one `<th>` tag for each category and `<td>` tags for skills.

**Code template**:  
```
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Category 1</th>
		<td>Skill 1</td>
		<td>Skill2</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

>Don't forget about the italic **Skills** title enclosed in `<h2>` tag.
