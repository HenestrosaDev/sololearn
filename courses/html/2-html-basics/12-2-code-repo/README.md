# Adding a photo

Let's add a **photo** to the CV, placed right beneath your profession.

**Task**:  
1. Open the `<img>` tag and put the link to your photo (or any profile picture you want) inside the `src` attribute.

**Hint**: If you don't have a link to your photo, you can use [this one](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/avatars-99/62/avatar-370-456322-512.png) as a sample profile avatar.

**Example**:  
![ExamplecontentImage](https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=4610)

>You can adjust the size of the photo using the `height` and `width` attributes.
