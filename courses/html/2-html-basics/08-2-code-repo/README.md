# My Profession

Great job! It's common practice to add a **profession** at the top of the CV. Let's do that!

**Task**:  
1. Add your profession immediately below your first and last name using `<p>` paragraph.
2. Make your profession bold using `<strong>` tag inside the `<p>` element that you've just written.

**Example**:
