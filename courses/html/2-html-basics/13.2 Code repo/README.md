# Experience/Education

Now it's time to describe your **work experience** and/or **education**, which serves to highlight y​​our career path and development.

We will use an **unordered list** to present the information in a structured way, using bullets.

**Task**:  
1. Write **Experience** in *italics* enclosed in `<h2>` immediately below the **Summary** section paragraph.
2. Create a list using the `<ul>` tag, define each job with the `<li>` tag, and then insert the bolded job title into it.
3. Inside each `<li>` section write a short description of your job using the `<p>` element.

**Code template**:  
```
<ul>
	<li><b>Your job title 1</b>
		<p>Your job description 1</p>
	</li>
</ul>
```

>You can add an **Education** section in the same way and format. Don't forget about the **closing tags**.
