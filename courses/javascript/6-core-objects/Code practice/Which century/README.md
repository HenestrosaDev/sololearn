# The Math Object

Create a function that returns the century depending on the year given as a parameter.

---

**Sample input**:
```
1993
```

**Sample output**:
```
20
```

---

**Hint**: You need to divide 1993 by 100: 1993/100 = 19.93, then round it to the nearest integer, which is 20 in this case.

---

>Use `Math.ceil(x)` method, which returns x rounded upwards to the nearest integer.
