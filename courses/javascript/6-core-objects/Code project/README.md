# Store Manager

You are working on a Store Manager program, which stores the prices in an array. You need to add functionality to increase the prices by the given amount.

The `increase` variable is taken from user input. You need to increase all the prices in the given array by that amount and output to the console the resulting array.

> Use a loop to iterate through the array and increase all items.
