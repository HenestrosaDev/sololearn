# Words

You are making a text encryptor. It should take multiple words and output a combined version, where each word is separated by a dollar sign `$`. For example, for the words `"hello"`, `"how"`, `"are"`, `"you"`, the output should be `"$hello$how$are$you$"`.

The given code declares a class named `Add`, with a constructor that takes one rest parameter. Complete the code by adding a `print()` method to the class, which should generate the requested output.

> Note, that the dollar sign is placed at the beginning and at the end of the output.
