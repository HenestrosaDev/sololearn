# Math Operators

There are a lot of situations where you want to check someone’s age… not just at the bar!

You are given a program that takes the `age` of the user as input. Complete the code to check if the user is an adult, and output to the console the corresponding boolean value.

**Sample input**: 
```
20
```

**Sample output**: 
```
true
```

>If the user is **18 or older**, they’re considered an adult. `console.log(20 > 18)` outputs `true`.
