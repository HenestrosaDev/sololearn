# Currency Converter

You are making a currency converter app. Create a function called `convert`, which takes two parameters: the `amount` to convert, and the `rate`, and returns the *resulting amount*.  

The code to take the parameters as input and call the function is already present in the Playground. Create the function to make the code work.

**Sample input**:  
```
100
1.1
```

**Sample output**: 
```
110
```

> Converting 100 at the rate of 1.1 is equal to 100*1.1 = 110.
