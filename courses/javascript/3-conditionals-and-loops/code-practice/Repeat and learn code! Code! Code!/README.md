# The for loop

"Repetition is the mother of learning, the father of action, which makes it the architect of accomplishment." - Zig Ziglar.

Inspired by these words, let's create a little program that will output an expression which is given as input, 3 times.

---

**Task**: Complete the code to output the given expression **3 times**.

---

**Sample input**:  
```
Learning is fun!
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Learning is fun!
Learning is fun!
Learning is fun!
```

---

>Use the `for` loop to run the required part of the code as many times as needed.
