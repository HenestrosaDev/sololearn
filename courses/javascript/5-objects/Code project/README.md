# Contact Manager

You are working on a Contact Manager app. You have created the `Contact` object constructor, which has two arguments: `name` and `number`.

You need to add a `print()` method to the object, which will output the contact data to the console in the following format: `name: number`.

The given code declares two objects and calls their `print()` methods. Complete the code by defining the `print()` method for the objects.

> Notice the space after the colon, when outputting the contact data.
