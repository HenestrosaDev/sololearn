# Menu

You are making a digital Menu App.  
The menu choices are stored in an array called menu.

You need to take a number as input, which indicates the choice index, and output the corresponding item from the menu.

In case the index is not valid, your app should output `Invalid choice`.

The input indicates the index of the array, meaning 0 corresponds to the first item.
