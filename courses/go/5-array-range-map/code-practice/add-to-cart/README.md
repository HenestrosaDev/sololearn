# Shopping Cart

You are building a Shopping Cart.
It is represented by a `Cart` struct, which holds the item prices in an array called **prices**.

Your program needs to take the number of items as input, followed by the prices of the items.
Initialize a Cart of that size, and add the prices to the Cart's array. After that, call the Cart's `show()` method, which should output the total cost of the cart.

The given code includes comments as instructions.

>Use a normal loop to take the inputs, and a `range` loop to calculate the sum of all prices. Also, note that the prices are `floats`.
