# Menu

You are making a digital Menu App. The menu choices are stored in an array called `menu`.

You need to take a number as input, which indicates the choice index, and output the corresponding item from the menu.

In case the index is not valid, your app should output `Invalid choice`.
The input indicates the index of the array, meaning **0** corresponds to the first item.

**Sample input**:
```

**Sample output**:
```
Cake
```

>The `menu` array is already defined in the code.
