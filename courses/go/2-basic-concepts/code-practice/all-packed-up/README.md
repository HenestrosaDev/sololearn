# Packaging

You work at a packaging company and need to create a program to calculate how many items will be packaged in the last box of a shipment.
A **box fits 7 items**. You have **1081 items to package** for the shipment.

Your program needs to calculate and output how many items will remain the last box after you package them in boxes of 7 items.

>Recall the **modulo operator** (`%`) â€” it can be used to get the remainder after division.
