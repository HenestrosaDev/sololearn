# Temperature Checker

You are writing a program for a temperature checking system at an airport.

The system measures the body temperature of a person and needs to output `Allowed` if it is in the normal range, or `Fever` if it is higher than normal.
- **Normal**: up to 99.5 °F
- **Fever**: > 99.5 °F

The program should take the temperature as a float from input and output the corresponding message.

**Sample input**:
```
101.3
```

**Sample output**:
```
Fever
```

>Use an **if/else** statement to make the decision.
