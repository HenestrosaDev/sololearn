# Contact Card

Your friend created a program that declares a number of variables to hold contact data and then outputs them.
However, the data types are wrong so the program does not work.

Fix the code by changing the data types of the variables to work with their given values.

>Look at the values that are assigned to the variables to understand what type they should have.
