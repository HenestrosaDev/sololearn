# Sound Frequencies

The human ear can hear sounds with frequencies in the range of **20 Hz** to **20,000 Hz**.
This is called the Audible frequency.
Anything below 20 Hz is called **Infrasound**, while anything above 20,000 Hz is called **Ultrasound**.

You need to make a program that takes a sound frequency as input and outputs the corresponding category.
