# Leaderboard

You are given a program that should output the even ranks of a leaderboard. 
However, somebody added and removed comments in the code, breaking that logic.

Fix the code by commenting and uncommenting the corresponding lines to generate the desired output.

>The resulting program should output only the even ranks of the leaderboard.
