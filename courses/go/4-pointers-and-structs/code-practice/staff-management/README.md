# Employee Management

You are building an Employee Management system.
Each **Employee** has the following fields: `name`, `age`, `position`, and `salary`.

The given code creates an `Employee` with the provided values and generates output based on the data.

Complete the program by defining the `Employee` struct with the correct fields, so that the code in `main()` works as expected.

>Make sure to use the correct data types for the struct fields.
