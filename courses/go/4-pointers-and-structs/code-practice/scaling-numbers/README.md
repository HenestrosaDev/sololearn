# Scale Factor

You are building a program that needs to scale numbers by the given factor.

The number and scale factor should be provided as input and passed to a function called `scale()`, which should then scale the number.
The `scale()` function needs to scale the number in-place using a pointer.

**Sample input**:
```
4
1.5
```

**Sample output**:
```
6
```

---

The code in `main()` already takes the required inputs and calls the function.

>Note, that the scale factor is a `float`.
