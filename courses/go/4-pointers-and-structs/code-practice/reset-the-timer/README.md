# Reset the Timer

The given code declares a `Timer` struct, which is initialized in `main()`.
You need to add a reset functionality to the program.

The `reset()` function needs to take a pointer to the struct as its argument and reset the seconds value to 0.

>Do not change the code in `main()`. Add the `reset()` function, so that the code you are given works as expected.
