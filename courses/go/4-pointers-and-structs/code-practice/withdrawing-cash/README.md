# Withdraw

You are working on a banking app.

The code declares a `BankAccount` struct with a `balance` field.
You need to add a `withdraw()` method for the `BankAccount` struct. It should take an **integer** argument and decrease the `balance` of the `BankAccount` by the given amount.

In case there is not enough money in the account, the method should output `Insufficient Funds`.

>The code in `main()` takes the amount to withdraw as input, and calls the withdraw() method.
