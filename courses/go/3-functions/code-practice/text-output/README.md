# Go!

You are given code that includes calls to a function called `talk()`, which should output the text `GO`.
The function is called 3 times in `main()`, but the code is missing the function declaration.

Add the missing code to declare the `talk()` function, which should output `GO` to the screen.

>Note, that the output should be in all caps.
