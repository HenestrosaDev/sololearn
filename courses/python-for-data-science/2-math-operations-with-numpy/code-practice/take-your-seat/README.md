# Seats in a Theater

You are given an array that represents the occupancy of seats in a movie theater. A seat marked with 1 is occupied, while one marked 0 means the seat is free.

However, the array is flat and 1-dimensional. Transform it into a **2-dimensional array**, representing the rows of the seats.

Each row in the theater has **5 seats** and there are a total of **30 seats**. Reshape the array into the corresponding shape and output the row at the given index, which is taken from user input.

>The row index is taken from user input in the given code.
