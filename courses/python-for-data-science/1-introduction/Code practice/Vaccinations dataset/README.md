# Number of Vaccinations

Using the same vaccinations dataset, which includes the number of times people got the flu vaccine.

The dataset contains the following numbers:
- never: 5
- once: 8
- twice: 4
- 3 times: 3

Calculate and output the **variance**.

We will soon learn about easier ways to calculate the variance and other summary statistics using Python. For now, use Python code to calculate the result using the corresponding equation.

>**Hint**: The **variance** is the average of the squared differences from the **mean**.
