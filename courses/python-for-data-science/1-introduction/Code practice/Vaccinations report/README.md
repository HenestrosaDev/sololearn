# Number of Vaccinations

We have a report on the number of flu vaccinations in a class of 20 people.

It has the following numbers:
- never: 5
- once: 8
- twice: 4
- 3 times: 3

What is the mean number of times those people have been vaccinated? Output the result using the `print()` statement.

>**Hint**: Think about the data this way: it contains 20 values, each representing the number of vaccinations the corresponding person had.
