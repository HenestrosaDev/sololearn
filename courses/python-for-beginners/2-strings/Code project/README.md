# Strings

You need to make a program for a leaderboard. The program needs to output the numbers 1 to 9, each on a separate line, followed by a dot:  
```
1.  
2.  
3.
...
```

>You can use the `\n` newline character to create line breaks, or, alternatively, create the desired output using three double quotes `"""`.
