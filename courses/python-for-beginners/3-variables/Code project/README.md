# Tip Calculator

When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount. But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure! You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.

Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a **float**.

**Sample input**: 
```
50
```

**Sample output**: 
```
10.0
```

>**Explanation**: 20% of 50 is 10.  
>To calculate 20% of a given amount, you can multiply the number by 20 and divide it by 100: `50*20/100 = 10.0`
