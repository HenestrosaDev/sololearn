# for Loops

You're making a shopping cart program.

The shopping cart is declared as a list of prices, and you need to add functionality to apply a discount and output the total price.

Take the discount percentage as input, calculate and output the total price for the shopping cart.

>Use a for loop to iterate over the list.  
>Use the following formula to calculate the result of X% discount on $Y price: `Y - (Y*X/100)`
