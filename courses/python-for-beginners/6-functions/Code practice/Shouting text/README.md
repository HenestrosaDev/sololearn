# String Functions

Your friend is sending you a text message, however his caps lock is broken and the whole message is in uppercase.

No one likes being shouted at, plus uppercase text is hard to read, so you decide to write a program to convert the text to lowercase and output it.

Take a string as input and output it in lowercase.

>Strings have useful function that convert the case.
