# BMI Calculator

Tracking your BMI is a useful way of checking if you’re maintaining a healthy weight. It’s calculated using a person's weight and height, using this formula: `weight / height²`

The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
- **Underweight**: = less than 18.5
- **Normal**: = more or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
- **Overweight**: = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
- **Obesity**: = 30 or more

Let’s make finding out your BMI quicker and easier, by creating a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and outputs the corresponding BMI category.
