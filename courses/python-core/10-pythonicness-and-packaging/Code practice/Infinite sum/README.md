# Function Arguments

Given a function that takes **2 arguments** and returns their **sum**. But we get an error when we want to sum **more than 2 numbers**. Change the function and complete the code so that the function sums as many numbers as are input.

>`*args` are accessible as the tuple args in the body of the function, so you can iterate through its items.
