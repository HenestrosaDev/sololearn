# Operator Overloading

The `__add__` method allows for the definition of a custom behavior for the `+` operator in our class.

The provided code is trying to add together two `BankAccount` objects, which should result in a new object with the **sum of the balances** of the given accounts.

Fix the code to make it work as expected and output the resulting account balance.

>The `__add__` method needs to take **2 parameters**, which represents the objects you are adding.
