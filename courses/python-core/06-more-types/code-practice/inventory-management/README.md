# Dictionaries

Dictionaries can be used to store `key:value` pairs.

You have been asked to create an inventory management program for a store. You use a dictionary to track all the store's inventory along with how many of each item the store has.
```
store = {"Orange": 2, "Watermelon": 0, "Apple": 8, "Banana": 42} 
```

Complete the provided code to output the **number of apples** present in the store.

>Dictionaries can be indexed just like lists, using **square brackets** (`[]`).
