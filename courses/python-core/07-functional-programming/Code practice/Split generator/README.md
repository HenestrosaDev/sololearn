# Generators

Given a string as input, create a **generator function** that splits the string into separate words and outputs the resulting list.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
This is some text
```

**Sample output**: 
```
['This', 'is', 'some', 'text']
```

>You can use the `split()` function to split the input string.
