# More Metacharacters

Let's imagine we are creating our own authentication system.

Create a program that takes a password as input and returns `Password created` if
- it has at least **one uppercase character**
- it has at least **one number**

The program should output `Wrong format` if requirements above are not met.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
Hal44gb8
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Password created
```

---

>Use metacharacter `*` that means zero or more repetitions.
