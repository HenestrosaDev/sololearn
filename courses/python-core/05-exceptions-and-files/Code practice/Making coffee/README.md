# Exception Handling

A coffee vending machine makes 5 types of coffee:
```
coffee = ["CafÃ© Latte", "Caffe Americano", "Espresso", "Cappuccino", "Macchiato"] 
```

Each coffee option has its own number, starting with 0. Write a program that will take a number from the customer as input from the customer and serve the corresponding coffee type. If the customer enters a number that is out of the accepted range, the program should output `Invalid number`. Regardless of coffee option result, the program should output `Have a good day` at the end.
