# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.

The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words **Solo** and **Learn** instead of **Fizz** and **Buzz**.

It takes an input `n` and outputs the numbers from 1 to `n`.
- For each multiple of 3, print `Solo` instead of the number.
- For each multiple of 5, prints `Learn` instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output `SoloLearn`.

You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.

>Remember, the `continue` statement can be used to skip a loop iteration.
