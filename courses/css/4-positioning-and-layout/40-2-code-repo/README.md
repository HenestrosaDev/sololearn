# The Final Touch!

Great job! The only thing we need to complete the design is the alignment of the profile picture and icons. We will use the `float` property to perform this alignment.

**Task**
1. In the HTML code, put your profile picture link into the `src` attribute. If you don't have any links, you can use the given default link that's already been inserted.
2. In the CSS code, select the `img` class, and add `float: right` property.
3. Select the `icon` class and add `float: left` property. Also, define the left padding.

**Example**
```
img {
    float: right;
}

.icon {
    float: left;
    color: #2F5A78;
}
```

>Don't forget to put your social accounts links into `href` attributes in the `social` section of the HTML code to make them work.
