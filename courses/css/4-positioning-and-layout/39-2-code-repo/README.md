# The Skills Section

Now for the last part of designing this section! Let's align the progress bars correctly to achieve a better appearance.

**Task**:
1. In the CSS code, set a static width for the `skill_name` section, using `width` property. This will allow bars to start from the same horizontal position.
2. Add a right margin to the `skill_per` element to define some distance from the right edge.

**Example**
```css
.skill_name {
    width: 4px;
}

.skill_per {
    margin-right: 15px;
} 
```
