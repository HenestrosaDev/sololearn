# Font colors

You are doing really great! Now, let's make your resume even more eye-pleasing by defining the colors for the text in each section.

**Task**: In the CSS code, define font colors for the `intro` and `subheading` elements using the `color` property.
Also, set a color for the icons in the contact information section (`icon` div).

Example
```css
.intro {
    background-color: #2F5A78;
    color: white;
} 

.subheading {
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: bolder;
    color: #2F5A78;
}

.icon {
    color: #2F5A78;
}
```

>In our example for the `subheading` and `icon` sections we used the color of the background for the `intro` section.
