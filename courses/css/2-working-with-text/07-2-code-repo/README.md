# Font Family

You are doing great!
Now, let's fill in your **contact information**, then specify the font for the entire resume.

**Task**
1. In **Contact Information** section of the HTML code, write your address, mobile number, and email in the `data` elements which are written in the corresponding sequence.
2. In the CSS code, select the `body` element and set the font you prefer using `font-family` property. This will specify the font for all the content.

**Example**
```css
body {
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif
}
```
