# Welcome to Resume Design Project

Welcome to the Resume Design Project! During this project, we will build an eye-catching resume design step by step!
You will be given an HTML template, and during this project, we will work on its style using CSS.
Review the task, write your code, commit it to save your progress, and continue the project through each of its stages.

First, let's write your first and last name at the top and set its font size.

**Task**:
1. In the HTML code, "Intro" section, write your name and surname inside the `<div class="heading">` tag.
2. In CSS code, select the `heading` element and set a font size for it using `font-size` property.

**HTML Example**
```html
<div class="heading">John Smith</div> 
```

**CSS Example**
```css
.heading {
    font-size: 35px;
}
```
