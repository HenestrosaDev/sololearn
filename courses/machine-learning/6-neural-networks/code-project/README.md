# Machine Learning - The Sigmoid Function

Calculate Node Output.

**Task**:
You are given the values for `w1`, `w2`, `b`, `x1` and `x2` and you must compute the output for the node. Use the sigmoid as the activation function.

---

**Input format**:  
w1, w2, b, x1 and x2 on one line separated by spaces

**Output format**:  
Float rounded to 4 decimal places

**Sample input**:
```
0 1 2 1 2
```

**Sample output**:
```
0.9820
```
