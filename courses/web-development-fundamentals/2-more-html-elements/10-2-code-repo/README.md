# Forms

Now we can create a section to enable users to buy tickets.

**Tasks**:
1. Add a new `<section>` below the first one, but above the footer.
2. Create a form inside that section, which includes two text fields and their corresponding labels. (one for Adult tickets, and another one for Children).
3. Use the number type for the inputs.
4. Use the `<br>` tag to separate the text fields into separate lines.

**Hint**: Here is an example form with an input and its label:
```
<label for="name">Name</label>
<input type="number" id="name"> 
```

Here is the expected result:
