# Welcome to Code Repo!

In this project we will build a Ticketing Website for the Eiffel Tower in Paris!

We will start from the basic web structure, then style the page and create a ticket price calculation section. Let's get started with some basic HTML!

**Task**: The code provides a short description text for the Eiffel Tower. Wrap the text with paragraph tags. Add a new paragraph where you see a line break (you should make 3 paragraphs).

**Hint**: A paragraph should start with the `<p>` tag and end with the closing `</p>` tag. For example:
```
<p>some text</p>
```

Here is what you should get as the result:
