# More on Elements

In this exercise we will make the image a link to the larger version.

**Tasks**:
1. Make the image a link to the image address.
2. Add the corresponding attribute to open the link in a new tab.

**Hint**: A link is created using the `<a>` tag. To make it open in a new tab, the `target` attribute is used:
```
<a href="https://test.com" target="_blank">
  some link
</a>
```

>After adding the link, you should be able to click on the image and open a larger version of it.
