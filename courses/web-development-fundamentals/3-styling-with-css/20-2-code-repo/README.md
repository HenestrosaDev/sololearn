# Backgrounds

Let's add some background colors to our containers.

**Tasks**:
1. Set the background color of the section elements **white**.
2. Set the background color of the whole page to `#e0e0e0`. This can be done by targeting the body element.
3. For our section with the form: give it an `id="buy"` attribute, so you can target it specifically. Then apply the following styles:
	- set the background color to `#687373;`
	- provide `10px` top margin.
	- change the color of the text to `#fcfcfc;`

**Hint**: Remember, targeting by id is done using the following syntax:
```
#buy {
	background-color: red;
}
```

Here is the expected result:
