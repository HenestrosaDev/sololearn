# Styling Forms

We are going to change a lot in the **buy** form. Let's start with some basic styling.

**Tasks**:
1. Give **2px** padding to the number text fields, align their text to the **center**.
2. Set the width of the number fields to **50px**.
3. Set the background color of the button to `#2493df`. Set the text on the button to be **bold, 16px** in size and **white**.
4. Remove the default border of the button using `border: none;`

**Hint**: To target specific types of inputs, use the following syntax:
```
input[type="number"] {
	padding:2px;
	text-align: center;
	width:50px;
} 
```

We will be changing the structure of the form in the next lessons, so don't worry that the form looks messy:
