# CSS Selectors

Time for some styles! Let's start with text colors:

**Tasks**:
1. Make the `<strong>` elements use the color #2493df for their text.
2. Change the color of the `footer` text to `#595959`.

**Hint**: Use element names to create CSS selectors. For example, here is how we would select the footer element and specify a color for its text:
```
footer {
  color: red;
}
```
