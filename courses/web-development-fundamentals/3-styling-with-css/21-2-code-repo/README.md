# Styling Lists

We have one bulleted list on our page for the Transport section.
Let's add some styling to it!

**Tasks**:
1. Change the round bullets to squares.
2. Change the position of the bullets to be inside the items.
3. Add **30px** padding to the left of the list.

>**Hint**: The bullet type of the list can be changed using the `list-style-type` property, while their position - using `list-style-position`.
