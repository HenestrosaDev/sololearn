# Functions

Functions are useful when we need to take inputs and generate an output.
Let's replace our price calculation with a function call!

**Tasks**:
1. Create a function called `calc()`, which takes two parameters, `adults` and `children`.
2. Calculate and **return** the **ticket price** from the function.
3. Replace the code that assigns the price variable to the price calculation formula with the function call.

**Hint**: This is how the price variable should be assigned a value, when the `calc()` function is defined:
```
price = calc(adults, children); 
```
