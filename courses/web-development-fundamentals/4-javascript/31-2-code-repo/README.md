# Loops

We need to create a program that prints the tickets.

**Task**: Create a loop for the adult tickets, and for each ticket, output its number in the following format:
```
Ticket #1
Ticket #2
... 
```

**Hint**: Here is an example for loop:
```
for (let i=1; i<=adults; i++) {
  //some code
} 
```

>To output text and combine it with a number, use the `+` operator, for example: `console.log("Ticket #" + num);`
