# Water Consumption

Each day a family consumes 15 liters of water. Given the number of `years` as input, you need to calculate and output the amount of water consumed in that period.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
5
```

**Sample output**: 
```
27375
```

---

The water consumption in 5 years would be: `5 * 365 * 15 = 27375`

---

>Use **365** as the number of days in a year.
