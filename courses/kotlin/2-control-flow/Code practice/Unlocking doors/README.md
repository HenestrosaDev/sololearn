# Open/Closed

You are making a program for a security system that opens/closes the door based on the time of the day.

Your program needs to take the `hour` as input (from 0 to 24) and output `Open` if it's **less than or equal to 18** or `Closed` in other cases.

**Sample input**: 
```
21
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Closed
```

>The given code takes the `hour` value from user input.
