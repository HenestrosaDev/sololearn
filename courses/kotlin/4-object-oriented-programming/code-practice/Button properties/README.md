# Button Setter

You continue working on the `Button` class.

You need to have a minimum `height` for the `Buttons` - it cannot have a value **below 50**. You decide to create a **setter** for the `height` property so that if the provided value is less than 50, it is set as 50.

>Create a valid **setter** for the `height` property so that the code works as expected.
