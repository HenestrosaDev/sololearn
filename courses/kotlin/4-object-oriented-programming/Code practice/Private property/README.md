# Restricting Access

Someone modified your code to restrict public access to the `width` and `height` properties. However, there are mistakes in the code and it does not run.

Fix the given code, so that `width` and `height` are accessible only in the derived classes, and the class functions are accessible from main.

>It is common practice to restrict access to `internal` properties and allow users to get/set their values using class functions or **getters/setters**.
