# Creating a Table

You need to make a `leaderboard` for a video game.

It should have the following columns:
- `place (INT)`
- `nickname (VARCHAR)`
- `rating (INT)`

Write a query to create this table and insert the following top 3 players:  
- `1, Predator, 9500`
- `2, JohnWar, 9300`
- `3, NightWarrior, 8900`

Finally, show the resulting table.

>Recall the `INSERT` statement to add the required data to the table.
