# String Formatting

The `format()` method provides an easy way to format strings.

Take as input a `name` and an `age`, and generate the output `name is age years old`.

- **Sample input**:  
```
James
42
```

- **Sample output**:
```
James is 42 years old
```

>Recall, you can use braces (`{}`) to embed variable values into strings.
