Tuples

You are given coordinates of **2 points** and need to find the straight line distance between them.

The coordinates are provided in a tuple, for example: `p = (8, 11)`

The first value represents the `x` coordinate, while the second value represents the `y` coordinate of the point `p`.

Complete the provided code to calculate and output the distance between the two given points.

>The linear distance is the **square root of the square of the horizontal distance plus the square of the vertical distance between two points**.  
The `math.sqrt()` function can be used to calculate the square root.
