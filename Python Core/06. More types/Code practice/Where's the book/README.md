# Dictionary Functions

You can use the `get()` method to find keys in a dictionary, and use a second parameter to return a default value, in case the key is not found.

Rewrite the given code to use the `get()` method instead of the `if/else` statements.
Also, change the output to `Book not found`, when the book is not found.

>Note how much shorter the resulting code is, compared to the `if/else` statement.
