Two friends want to play backgammon, but have lost the dice.

Create a program to replace the dice. When the program is run, it should roll the dice and output the result of each die.

**Hint**: Use `random.randint()` function to generate random values in the range of **1 to 6** for each dice.

>You will see a `random.seed(int(input()))` line in sample code. It initializes the pseudorandom number generator and, in this case, ensures functionality of test cases.
