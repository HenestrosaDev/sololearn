# Adding Words

You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by dashes (-). 

The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.

- **Sample Input:**<br>
this<br>
is<br>
great

- **Sample Output:**<br>
this-is-great<br>

>Recall, using **\*args** as a function parameter enables you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function.
