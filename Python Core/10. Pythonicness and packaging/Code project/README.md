# Adding Words

You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by **dashes** (`-`). 

The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.

- **Sample input**:  
```
this
is
great
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
this-is-great
```

>Recall, using `*args` as a function parameter enables you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function.
