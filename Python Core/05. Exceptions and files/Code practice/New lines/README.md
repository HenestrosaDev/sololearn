# Writing Files

You are given the following list: `names = ["John", "Oscar", "Jacob"]`

Complete the program to create a file where you write the names from the list, each on a new line, and separately output them.

**Output**:  
```
John  
Oscar  
Jacob  
```

>Remember that `\n` represents a new line.
