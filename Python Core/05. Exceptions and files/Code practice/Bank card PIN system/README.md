# Exception Handling

We need to create a program that allows users to create their own PIN codes for their bank cards. Each PIN code consists of **digits**. 

Complete the program so that when the user enters a character, the program stops and outputs `Please enter a number` and, when the user enters only digits, the program outputs `PIN code is created`.

**Sample input**: 
```
44a5
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Please enter a number
```

>Recall `int()` function, that occurs an error when the argument is not a number.
