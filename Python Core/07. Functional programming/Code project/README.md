# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.
Each number in the sequence is **the sum of the two numbers that precede it**.

For example, here is the Fibonacci sequence for 10 numbers, starting from 0: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`.

Write a program to take **N** (variable num in code template) positive numbers as input, and recursively calculate and output the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).

- **Sample input**:  
`6`

- **Sample Output**:  
`0`  
`1`  
`1`  
`2`  
`3`  
`5`  

>If you are making the Fibonacci sequence for **n** numbers, you should use `n <= 1` condition as the **base case**.
