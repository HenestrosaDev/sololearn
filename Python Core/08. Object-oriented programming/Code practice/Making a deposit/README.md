# Data Hiding

You are given a `BankAccount` class and need to add a `deposit()` method to it, which adds the given amount to the private `balance` property.

The code should declare a `BankAccount` object with an initial `balance` of **0**, take a number from user input, add it to the balance using the `deposit()` method, and output the object.

Complete the required `deposit()` method so the code works as expected and produces the required output.

>Remember, the methods in a class need to have `self` as their **first parameter**, which is used to access the properties.
