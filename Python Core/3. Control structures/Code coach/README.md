# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.
The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz". It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.

For each multiple of 3, print ```Solo``` instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, prints ```Learn``` instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output ```SoloLearn```.

You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.

>Remember, the continue statement can be used to skip a loop iteration.
