# Multiple Variables

You can use multiple variables to take multiple inputs for your program.
For example, the following code takes two inputs and stores them in the variables `x` and `y`:
```
x = input()
y = input()
```

**Task**: Given the code above, output the input `x` repeated `y` times.

- **Sample input**:  
```
awesome
3
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
awesomeawesomeawesome
```

>Remember, the `input()` function results in a string. You need to convert the result into the corresponding type, if you need to use it as a number.
