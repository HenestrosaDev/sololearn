# More Metacharacters

Let's imagine we are creating our own authentication system.

Create a program that takes a password as input and returns `Password created` if
- it has at least **one uppercase character**
- it has at least **one number**

The program should output `Wrong format` if requirements above are not met.

- **Sample input**: `Hal44gb8`
- **Sample Output**: `Password created`

>Use metacharacter `*` that means zero or more repetitions.
