# Character Classes

All the products in online shop have their own ID. Every ID consists of 4 symbols:
- The **first** symbol: an uppercase character
- The **second** symbol: an uppercase character
- The **third** symbol: a digit
- The **forth** symbol: a digit

Write a program for a search tool, that will take the **ID** as input and output `Searching` if the format is correct, and `Wrong format`, if it's not.

- **Sample input**: `LG17`
- **Sample output**: `Searching`

>Remember to use `$` sign in pattern to set the ending of the ID string.
