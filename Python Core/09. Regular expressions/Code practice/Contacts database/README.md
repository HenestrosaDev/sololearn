# Regular expressions

We need to create a number formatting system for a contacts database.

Create a program that will take the `phone` number as input, and if the number starts with `00`, replace them with `+`. The number should be printed after formatting.

- **Sample input**: `0014860098`
- **Sample Output**: `+14860098`

>Notice that here you shouldn't convert the input string to integer, because you will work with symbols.
