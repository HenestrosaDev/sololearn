# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.
Each number in the sequence is **the sum of the two numbers that precede it**.

For example, here is the Fibonacci sequence for 10 numbers, starting from 0: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.

Write a program to take N (variable num in code template) positive numbers as input, and recursively calculate and output the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).

- **Sample Input:**<br>
6

- **Sample Output:**<br>
0<br>
1<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
5

>If you are making the Fibonacci sequence for n numbers, you should use ```n <= 1``` condition as the **base case**.
