# Range

You are making a date picker for a website and need to output all the years in a given period.

Write a program that takes **two integers** as input and outputs the **range of numbers between the two inputs as a list**.

The output sequence should start with the first input number and end with the second input number, without including it.

- **Sample input**:  
`2005`  
`2011`  

- **Sample output**:  
`[2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]`

>You can convert a range object to a list and output it.
