# Lists

Imagine a vending machine that sells fruits. Each fruit has its own number, starting from **0**.

Write a program for the vending machine, which will take `n` number as input from the customer and return the fruit with that index.
```
fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"] 
```

If `n < 0` or `n > 7` (the index of last fruit ), the program outputs `Wrong number`.

**Sample input**: 
```
2
```

**Sample output**: 
```
banana
```

>Remember that the first element of the list has `0` index.
