Write a program to control entrance to a club. Only people who are **18 or older** are allowed to enter the club.

The given program takes the `age` and the `name` of the person who tries to enter. Complete the program to output `Welcome` followed by the `name` of the person if they are allowed to enter the club, and `Sorry` if they are younger than the allowed age.

- **Sample input**:  
```
24
James
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
Welcome James
```

>Do not forget to put a space between `Welcome` and the `name`.
