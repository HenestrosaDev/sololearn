# Reading files

Tom has done pull ups every day and recorded his results. He recorded each day's results in a new line, so that each line represents each day he has done pull ups.

Create a program that takes `n` number as input and outputs the `n-th` days result (starting from 0).

- **Sample input**: `4`
- **Sample output**: `Day 4, 9 pull ups`

>Recall the `readlines()` function that returns a list containing each line in the file as a list item.
