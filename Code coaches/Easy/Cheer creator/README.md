# Cheer Creator

You are cheering on your favorite team. After each play, if your team got over 10 yards further down the field, you stand up and give your friend **a high five**. If they don't move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say `shh`, and if they move forward 10 yards or less, you say `Ra!` for every yard that they moved forward in that play. 
 
---

**Task**: Given the number of yards that your team moved forward, output either `High Five` (for >10), `shh` (for <1), or a string that has a `Ra!` for every yard that they gained. 

---
 
**Input format**: An integer value that represents the number of yards gained or lost by your team.  
**Output format**: A string of the appropriate cheer.

**Sample input**: 
```
3
```

**Sample output**: 
```
Ra!Ra!Ra!
```

>**Explanation**: If your team gains 3 yards you would cheer `Ra!` three times for that play.
