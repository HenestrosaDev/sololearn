# Symbols

There is a problem with your keyboard: it randomly writes symbols when you are typing a text. You need to clean up the text by removing all symbols. 
 
---

**Task**: Take a text that includes some random symbols and translate it into a text that has none of them. The resulting text should only include letters and numbers. 

---
 
**Input format**: A string with random symbols. 
 
**Output format**: A string of the text with all the symbols removed.

**Sample input**: 
```
#l$e%ts go @an#d@@ g***et #l#unch$$$
```

**Sample output**: 
```
lets go and get lunch
```

>**Explanation**: If you take out every symbol and leave only the letters and numbers, your text says `lets go and get lunch`.
