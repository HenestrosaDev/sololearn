# Déjà Vu

You aren't paying attention and you accidentally type a bunch of random letters on your keyboard. You want to know if you ever typed the same letter twice, or if they are all unique letters. 
 
**Task**  
If you are given a string of random letters, your task is to evaluate whether any letter is repeated in the string or if you only hit unique keys while you typing. 
 
**Input format**  
A string of random letter characters (no numbers or other buttons were pressed). 
 
**Output format**  
A string that says `Deja Vu` if any letter is repeated in the input string or a string that says `Unique` if there are no repeats. 
 
- **Sample Input:** `aaaaaaaghhhhjkll` 
- **Sample output:** `Deja Vu`

>**Explanation**  
Your program should output `Deja Vu` because there are many repetitions in `aaaaaaaghhhhjkll`.
