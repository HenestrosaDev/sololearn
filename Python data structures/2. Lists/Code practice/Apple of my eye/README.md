# List Operations

You are given a 2D matrix, which represents the number of people in a room, grouped by their eye color and gender.

The first row represents the **male** gender, while the second row represents **females**.
The columns are the eye colors, in the following order: **brown**, **blue**, **green**, **black**.

```
data = [
  [23, 11, 5, 14],
  [8, 32, 20, 5]
] 
```

The data shows that, for example, there are **20** green eyed females in the room (2nd row, 3rd column).

Our program needs to take eye color as input and output the percentage of people with that eye color in the room.

- **Sample input**:
```
blue
```

- **Sample output**:
```
36
```

>**Explanation**: There are `11 + 32 = 43` people with blue eyes, which is **36%** of the total.

>Note, that the output should be an `integer`: use the `int()` function to convert the result.
