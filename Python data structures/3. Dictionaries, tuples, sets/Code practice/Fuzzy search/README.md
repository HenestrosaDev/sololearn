# Dictionary Functions

You are making a phonebook. The contacts are stored in a **dictionary**, where the **key is the name** and the **value is a list**, representing the **number** and the **email** of the contact.

You need to implement search: take the name of the contact as input and output the email.

If the contact is not found, output `Not found`.

>Note, that the email is the **second element** of the list.
