# Manipulating Strings

You are making a text editor and need to implement find/replace functionality.

The code declares a text string. You need to take two string inputs, which represent the substring to find and what to replace it with in the text.

Your program needs to output the number of replacements made, along with the new text. For example, for the given text `I weigh 80 kilograms. He weighs 65 kilograms.`:

- **Sample input**:  
```
kilograms
kg
```

- **Sample output**:
```
2
I weigh 80 kg. He weighs 65 kg.
```

The program replaced 2 occurrences of the word **kilograms** with **kg**.

>Note, that you need to output the number of replacements, before the replaced text.
