# Letter Frequency

You are making a program to analyze text.

Take the text as the first input and a letter as the second input, and output the frequency of that letter in the text as a whole percentage.

- **Sample input**:  
`hello`  
`l`

- **Sample output**:
`40`

**Explanation**: The letter **l** appears 2 times in the text `hello`, which has **5 letters**. So, the frequency would be `(2 / 5) * 100 = 40`.

>Division result is a `float`. Use the `int()` function to convert the result to an `integer`.
