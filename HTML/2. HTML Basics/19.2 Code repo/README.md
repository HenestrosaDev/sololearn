# Message, Part 1

Great job! You have reached the final section!

Let's create a static form which allows anyone who reads our CV the ability to write us messages in the future. We will do this in 2 steps.

As the first step, we will create the **Name** and the **Email** fields.

**Task**:  
1. Write **Write me a message** in italics enclosed in the `<h2>`.
2. Immediately below, add `<form>` tag.
3. Inside the `<form>` tag, add two `<input>` elements - for **Name** and **Email** fields accordingly - each one in a **new line**.
4. In each `<input>` element, add the `placeholder` attribute with the corresponding value (**Name** and **Email**).

**Code template**:  
```
<form>
	<input placeholder="Name"/><br>
	<input placeholder="Email"/><br>
</form>
```

>The **placeholder** attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field.
