# Trip Planner

You need to plan a road trip. You are traveling at an average speed of **40 miles an hour**.

Given a distance in miles as input (the code to take input is already present), output to the console the time it will take you to cover it **in minutes**.

**Sample input**: 
```
150
```

**Sample output**: 
```
225
```

---

> **Explanation**: It will take **150 / 40 = 3.75 hours** to cover the distance, which is equivalent to **3.75 * 60 = 225 minutes**.
