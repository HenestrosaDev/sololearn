# Trip Planner

You need to plan a road trip. You are traveling at an average speed of **40 miles an hour**.

Given a distance in miles as input (the code to take input is already present), output to the console the time it will take you to cover it **in minutes**.

- **Sample input**: `150`
- **Sample output**: `225`

> **Explanation**: It will take 150/40 = 3.75 hours to cover the distance, which is equivalent to 3.75*60 = **225** minutes.
