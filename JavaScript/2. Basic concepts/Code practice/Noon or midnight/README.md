# Logical or boolean operators

Time flies when youâ€™re having fun. Given a clock that measures 24 hours in a day, write a program that takes the hour as input. If the hour is in the range of 0 to 12, output `am` to the console, and output `pm` if it's not.

**Sample input**: 
```
13
```

**Sample output**: 
```
pm
```

>Assume the input number is positive and less than or equal to 24.
