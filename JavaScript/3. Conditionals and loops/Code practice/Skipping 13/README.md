# Break and continue

Many tall buildings, including hotels, skip the number 13 when numbering floors, often going from floor 12 to floor 14. It is thought that the number 13 is unlucky.

Write a program that will number **15 rooms** starting from 1, **skipping the number 13**. Output to the console each room number in separate line.

>Be attentive: considering the missing number, the number of last room should be **greater than the count of rooms by 1**.
