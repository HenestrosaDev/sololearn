# Class Methods in ES6

You are making a program so that students are able to calculate their average of 3 exam scores.

The given program takes the scores of 3 exams as input and declares the `Exams` class.
Add a `static method average()` to class `Exams`, which will take the `scores` as parameters, and calculate and return the average score **rounded to the nearest integer** so that the code in main works correctly.

- **Sample input**:  
```
74
80
68
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
74
```

>Recall `Math.round()` function to round the number with the floating point to the nearest integer.
