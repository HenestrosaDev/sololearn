# Function Parameters

Sometimes, it's very useful to set reminder to help you accomplish all of your tasks.

The program you are given takes an event as input. Complete the function-reminder to take that event as argument and output the corresponding message.

- **Sample input**: `workout`
- **Sample output**: `You set a reminder about workout`

>Use `+` operator to concatenate string values together.  
For example, `console.log("JS is " + "fun!")` will output `JS is fun`.
