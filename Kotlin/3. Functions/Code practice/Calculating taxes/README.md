# Tax Calculator

You need to create an app to calculate the after tax price of goods. The tax rate is **15%**.

Define a function that takes the **before tax price** as its argument, and outputs the **after tax price**.

The given code takes the before tax price in `Double` format as input and calls the `calc()` function.

---

**Sample input**: 
```
140.0
```

**Sample output**: 
```
161.0
```

---

**Explanation**: The tax on 140.0 is 21.0, which makes the after tax price `140.0 + 21.0 = 161.0`

---

>Define the `calc()` function so that the given code works as expected.
