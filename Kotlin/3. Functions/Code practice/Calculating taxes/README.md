# Tax Calculator

You need to create an app to calculate the after tax price of goods. The tax rate is **15%**.

Define a function that takes the **before tax price** as its argument, and outputs the **after tax price**.

The given code takes the before tax price in `Double` format as input and calls the `calc()` function.

- **Sample input**: `140.0`
- **Sample output**: `161.0`

**Explanation**: The tax on 140.0 is 21.0, which makes the after tax price `140.0 + 21.0 = 161.0`

>Define the `calc()` function so that the given code works as expected.
