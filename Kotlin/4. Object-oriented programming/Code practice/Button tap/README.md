# Button Tap

Let's add some behavior to our `Button` class! You need to define a `tap()` function for the `Button` class. The function should output the message `button was tapped`, where "**button**" is the *name of the object*. This means that you also need to add a `name` property to the `Button` class.

The code in `main` takes the name of the `Button` as input, assigns it to the property, and calls the `tap()` function.

- **Sample input**: `Send`
- **Sample output**: `Send was tapped`

>Note that the constructor should include only the `width` and `height` properties.
