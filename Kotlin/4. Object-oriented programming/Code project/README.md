# Music Player

You are building a Music Player app. You need to implement the `MusicPlayer` class, which should hold the `songs` names as `Strings` in an array. The array is already defined in the given code.

The player should support the following functions:
- `add`: add the given argument `song` to the `songs` array.
- `show`: output all `songs` names in the player on separate lines.
- `play`: start playing the first song by outputting `Playing name` where `name` is the first song name.

You can add a new item to an array using `+=`, for example `songs += song`.

>The code in `main` takes song names from user input and calls the player functions. Do not modify the code in `main`.
