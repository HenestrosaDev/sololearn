# Age Groups

Given an age as input, you need to output the age group according to the following categories:  
- **Child**: 0 - 11
- **Teen**: 12 - 17
- **Adult**: 18 - 64
- **Senior**: 65+

In case the age is negative, you need to output `Invalid age`.

- **Sample input**: `42`
- **Sample output**: `Adult`

>You can use a `when` statement to create the conditions and return the corresponding values.
