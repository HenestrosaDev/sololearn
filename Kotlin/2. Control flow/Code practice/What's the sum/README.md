# Sum in Range

You need to make an app that calculates the sum of all numbers in a given range.

Take two numbers as input, defining the `start` and `end` of the range. Then, calculate the `sum` of all numbers in that range and output the result.

- **Sample input**:  
```
5
9
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
35
```

>The sum of all number in the range 5 to 9 is: `5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35`
