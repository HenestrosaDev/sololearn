# Continuous Input

The given code uses an infinite while loop to take continuous user input.
During each iteration a number is taken from the input.

You need to fix the program to stop the loop when the user enters `0` and output the number of inputs taken before that.

- **Sample input**:  
```
42
1
66
0
```

- **Sample output**:  
```
3
```

>**Hint**: Use a `break` statement to stop the loop when the user input is 0.
