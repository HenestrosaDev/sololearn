You are working on a notification system. 

Your program needs to take the `name` of the user as input and output `Welcome, name!`, where `name` is the input value.

- **Sample input**: `John`
- **Sample output**: `Welcome, John!`

You can use the `+` operator to combine strings in the output.

>Your program needs to match the required output format, including the comma, the space and the exclamation mark at the end.
